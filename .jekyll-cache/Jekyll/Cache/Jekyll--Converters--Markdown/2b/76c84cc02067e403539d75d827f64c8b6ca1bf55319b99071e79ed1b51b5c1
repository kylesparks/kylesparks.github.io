<p>George Orwell and Zack De La Rocha both agree that â€œwho controls the past controls the futureâ€â€”so weâ€™re going to need to start this at the beginning. Way back in history with the original aliens. Iâ€™m speaking, of course, about Ancient Aliens.</p>

<p>Ancient Aliens is a popular show that recently started its 15th season on the History Channel. The show attempts to weave a constellation of texts and drawings to make a case for pre-historic contact between humans and extraterrestrials. The basic premise boils down to this: a bunch of weird things happened throughout ancient history, and the only plausible answer is that they got help from aliens.</p>

<p>Example: How is it that civilizations across the world built structures that used the same blueprint?

<p>How could anyone have done stonehenge without trucks to move around such massive boulders?

<p>And the Sphynx?

<p>How about all these hieroglyphs of guys sitting down in what could only possibly be a spaceship?

<p>Mayans were one of the most technologically advanced civilizations in recorded history, and they all just disappeared? Either they were always aliens, or they became aliens when they flew away from our planet for good.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an appealing narrative. But it also doesnâ€™t make a ton of sense. If aliens came down and built thisâ€¦

<p>â€¦where were they when we tried building this?

<p>The reality is that all of these ancient coincidences arenâ€™t really coincidences, nor are they â€œimpossible.â€ Theyâ€™re just reliant on really intelligent people working really hard and in coordination with each other.

<p>The reason the architectures look the same is because the materials look the sameâ€”unless your argument is that these same blueprints are implanted at birth by aliens.</p>

<p>And you actually can move massive blocks if you run enough water underneath, and use ropes and pulleys and whatever other engineering thingsâ€”those all existed.

<p>The reality is that Mayans didnâ€™t disappear. Maybe there was an epidemic, or some other natural disaster; or maybe the people just grew tired of their rulers and spread out in the jungle, and itâ€™s a lot harder to find their small villages than it was to find the massive city centers.

<p>But the more compelling evidence is that there are approximately 4 million people today who speak a Mayan language as their first language. These people didnâ€™t disappear; theyâ€™re still here today.

<p>I learned about all this stuff from this guy David S. Anderson, whoâ€™s pretty good at responding to these claims on Twitter, and he quickly helped me understand that all these Ancient Aliens concepts are pretty messed up, because theyâ€™re all built on this presumption that these older, non-western civilizations couldnâ€™t possibly have done anything good by themselves.</p>

<p>And anyway, if aliens were so prevalent in ancient times, where the heck have they been since?</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s something interesting I put together. Itâ€™s a graph charting UFO sightings by date.

<p>You see a few old ones. These are cool. But theyâ€™re also likely to be the result of natural phenomenon that is familiar to us know, or in some cases itâ€™s actually commonly believed to be â€œyellow journalism,â€ where the reporterâ€™s just, like, havinâ€™ a laugh. But what we see is that in the early to mid-20th century, we see an abrupt uptick in reports, steadily increasing till present day.</p>
