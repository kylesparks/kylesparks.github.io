title: Instant Editing With the Hemingway App

One of the constant struggles in learning to capital-W Write is being able to step back from your words and assess your message. It's the most challenging and stressful aspect because it's so easy to get lost in the materials of a craft. And while software developers can employ things like test-driven development to ensure their means are serving the interest of their ends, the common equivalents for writers seems to be time to reflect and a fresh set of eyes—neither of which are necessarily abundant. 

While writing a case study for 8th Light's website today, I experimented with using a resource called the Hemingway App. The Hemingway App works as an automated set of eyes that scans whatever prose you paste into its window. It counts the number of paragraphs, sentences, words, and characters; and then highlights sentences that are hard to read (requiring a college-level reading ability), sentences that are very hard to read (requiring a post-college-level reading ability), adverbs, words or phrases that can be simpler, and uses of passive voice. Having calculated all of that data, it assigns a reading level.

Because it's an automated app that isn't physically reading your text, this data should always be taken with a grain of salt. It will calculate most compound sentences that switch subjects as being very hard to read, though sometimes that sentence structure is essential to make a point clearly (case in point: this very sentence). 

It will also frequently claim that verbs "can be simpler," though simplifying them could come at the cost of an active, engaging voice. 

But at least for me, having these complicated sentences highlighted helps me allocate what focus my eyes still have in them to where it's needed most. 

The Hemingway App suggests aiming for a Grade Level less than 10 for bold, clear writing. 8th Light's two most developed case studies—Law Vault and NCSA—both graded out as requiring a Grade 13 reading level, and the one I just finished for Go Big Recruiting did as well.

After just a first pass and without having gone back to read anything, this blog post was given a Grade Level of 21. Woof.

But this is exactly where I was hoping the Hemingway App could become valuable, so I dug in deeper. I focused my energy revisiting only the sentences the App suggested were very hard to read, and picked them apart into more logical pieces as best as I could.  After addressing the most dire of them, this blog post now reads at a Grade Level of 13. That's still not ideal, but I think it shows that the Hemingway App has drastically improved my ability to edit things immediately after I've written them.
