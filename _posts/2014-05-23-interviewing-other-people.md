The third edition of Ken Metzler’s Creative Interviewing was published in 1997, so I was skeptical that it could provide my apprenticeship with any real lessons. But surprisingly, Metzler’s text has stayed mostly relevant because its focus rotates around the axis of human relationships, not journalistic conventions. It’s essentially a book about how to turn an interview into an insightful conversation—how to approach a source not as a target for interrogation, but as a sympathetic friend. 

The book’s actual applications were only slightly dated. What Metzler marvels as “new journalism” is now widely accepted as the norm. Nearly 50 years after In Cold Blood, we expect investigative pieces to be deeply, um, investigated; and we expect individual profiles to be comprised of multiple sources that triangulate the individual, not just storytelling from the individual’s shadow.

While Metzler was going through the outline of a profile piece as we now know it, two different examples immediately came to mind as illustrating two different means of reporting: the first one using a handful of sources to tease out the details of the individual from the inside-out, and the second using many sources to hone in on the details inherent in the individual from the outside-in.

Gene Weingarten has won two Pulitzer Prizes for Feature Writing, and “Pearls Before Breakfast” and “Fatal Distraction” are unsurprisingly incredible reads. But another one of his stories has stuck with me just as strongly. “The Peekaboo Paradox” is an in-depth profile in which Weingarten accompanies The Great Zucchini in his work as the D.C. area’s premier children’s party entertainer. Weingarten uses heavy scene descriptions and choice direct quotes to help readers uncover two crucial conflicts that have gone to define the man behind the rickety box of tricks, Eric Knaus. Although Weingarten interviewed several other sources, the story is primarily presented through the lens of the Great Zucchini. I can’t tell this story as well as Weingarten already did, so I’ll just cut myself off by saying that “Peekaboo Paradox” is an excellent case study in profile reporting from the inside-out.

In what came to be known as the Zanesville Zoo Massacre in 2011, a man named Terry Thompson allegedly committed suicide after letting his 18 tigers, 17 lions, 8 bears, 3 cougars, 2 wolves, 1 baboon, and 1 macaque loose from their cages, free to roam the quiet Ohio town.

Because Thompson was deceased, Chris Heath had no direct access to the subject of the profile he was assigned to write for GQ (link). Instead, Heath traveled around Ohio interviewing people on every side of the issue of domestic exotic animal ownership, as well as the neighbors, relatives, and authorities who came to know him in Zanesville. By gaining a deep understanding of the environment Thompson came from and talking to people who knew him more personally, Heath was able to approximate the psychological cocktail that drove Thompson over the edge of insanity. He worked from the outside-in, investigating the larger-than-you-expect group of exotic animal owners in Ohio and the obvious tensions that group is constantly trying to justify. 

His reporting was fundamentally different from Weingarten’s out of necessity, though I thought they both arrived at illuminating character studies.

But this story affords us another level to talk about Metzler’s book, too. Because while Heath was going around Ohio to report on Zanesville for GQ, Chris Jones was working the exact same assignment for Esquire, soon to be published as “Animals.” You can read an interview with Jones in which he mentions how he realized that a reporter from the rival magazine had already been interviewing the same people he was interviewing.

Yet despite talking to the same people and reporting the same story, they arrived at entirely different articles. They were collecting the same pieces, but fitting them into puzzles that hardly resembled each other.

Whereas Heath worked the periphery to illustrate the source, Jones dove right into the scene and recreated the chaos in the cinematic way for which he’s notorious. Chris Jones is a familiar name for anyone who reads tons of long reads, but that’s not necessarily a good thing. He has an ear for the cinematic; a penchant for trying to project each of his stories onto a big screen. The results are frequently thrilling: “Animals” certainly is, and so is “Home,” among many others. But his focus on grandeur can sometimes overlook the trees for the forest (never forget his glib take on the 2012 New York Marathon). Jones’ piece on Zanesville makes Terry Thompson seem like an exceptional nutcase; Heath’s makes Terry Thompson seem like a product of his environment. Both descriptions were pulled from the same source material.

The lesson I’m trying to demonstrate from Metzler’s book is that I think the difference between these two stories is likely a function of the interviewer’s ability to color and shape an interview. Metzler makes one thing very clear: It’s of paramount importance that we interview another person, not just a reflection of ourselves, or a reflection of a story, or a projection of a role that this person might embody during the period of time when your recorder is running. A perfect interview will provide a perfect depiction of the other person, one uninfluenced by the interviewee.

Throughout his reporting, you could see Weingarten slowly manage to peel himself away from the interviews enough to reveal the real Eric Knaus living underneath the Great Zucchini. Heath was able to accumulate enough interviews to reach a critical mass, and thus triangulate a central tension in the psychology of a human he could never know. Jones, on the other hand, seemed to be reporting on the scene, and the interviewees were merely characters operating inside of it. 

I should clarify that I’m picking on Chris Jones precisely because he’s incredibly successful and gifted in ways that make me jealous. But one small thought exercise I sometimes indulge myself in is to wonder, Had Chris Jones set out to profile the Great Zucchini, how differently might we think about Eric Knaus?
