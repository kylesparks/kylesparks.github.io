>Words are a barrier to communication.

That quote comes from Luke Sullivan’s Hey Whipple, Squeeze This, and is attributed to award-winning creative director John Hegarty. The quote stuck with me throughout the rest of the book, and spun a few different threads in my head. I’m going to break them out into two different posts to unpack two different aspects of communication in which words can act as barriers: thinking in part 1, and execution here in part 2.

In questions of linguistics, I’m no purist. If you’ve spent 20 minutes talking to me IRL, you’ve most likely heard me say things exactly like that—a colloquialism born of the Internet that’s borderline nonsense (it’s an acronym for In Real Life).

One thing I don’t want to risk is the impression that I’m some paragon of efficient communication, or even a visionary in the field of linguistics, because neither of those statements is even remotely true.

But the impetus of this post was the John Hegarty quotation “Words are a barrier to communication,” and I want to take that line as a framework through which we can analyze a running theme through everything I’ve read: avoid speaking down to readers. We should share a perspective and a language with our audience; talk with them instead of at them.

This reminds me of an old newsroom dilemma I went through several years ago when the AP Style Guide changed the formatting from e-mail to email. The AP Style Guide is the ultimate authority on grammar in most newsrooms, and this change left some people (including my Editor-In-Chief) shook. They didn’t change the formatting of e-commerce, e-reader, or e-book, so why email?

Well, I think that’s a simple case of missing the forest for the trees. E-commerce, e-reader, and e-book have not yet fully ingrained themselves into our social conscious, but eventually they probably will. More apt comparisons are things like how the AP Style Guide changed the format from Web site to website the year prior. The Internet (still capitalized until someone can prove it’s a common noun) has transitioned from being a commodity to a utility, and our language has slowly shifted to reflect that.

And that’s just the beginning. That same year, the Oxford English Dictionary added LOL, OMG, and FYI to its listings. Just this week, the AP Style Guide removed the distinction between “over” and “more than,” because the former had become such a common usage for describing larger values. Do you remember when Merriam-Webster broke down and finally put “ain’t” in the dictionary?

Despite the rigid sentence-diagramming and stuffy Daily Oral Language exercises we suffered through in school, language is not a declaration handed down by authorities above. It’s created by humans and defined by actual usage. Dictionaries and style guides expand and contract with a general sense of what the average human comprehends.

There’s inherent risk to applying this broadly, of course. This is a rare instance in which we might be sacrificing clarity for familiarity. But I appreciate this about our language. Words don’t have to be archaic or inaccessible. Words can live and breathe the same as the people who use them and the things they’re used to describe. And so long as we treat them like they’re fluid, they’re waterways, facilitators. Words themselves aren’t the barriers, it’s humans and our inability to use them correctly that inhibits communication. We need to think about language in a more abstract way so that the question becomes less about whether something is correct, and more about whether something is understood.
