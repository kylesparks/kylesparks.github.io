*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of july in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

**purple mountains**, david berman's return from an extended hiatus after silver jews, is so good. his lyrics are as sharp as ever, which is remarkable on its own. but having woods play behind him makes the whole record sound fuller and fresher. it's hard to ignore how autobiographical so much of the saddest moments seem, but the whole thing is such a triumph that it makes me hopeful this record is his way of putting it all behind him and beginning something new.

**strange ranger** have put out a few records of emo rock that i've liked quite a bit, but this new one, *remember the rockets*, is the moment they go from emo curiosity to full-fledged indie rock band that i hope blows up sooner than later.

### suggested, not required

**florist** recently got a [co-sign from beyoncé](https://www.stereogum.com/2040366/florist-beyonce-documentary-thank-you-song/news/), and i wonder what her fans will think of this new one. florist has only ever made soft, quiet pop records, but this one is deliberately the most stripped-down, quietest one yet. it's bleak, it's beautiful, i hope everyone likes it.

<br />

**angel olsen** has brought a slightly different vibe to each of records, and if the first single off her forthcoming album is any indication, it'll be the one where she sounds just absolutely massive and becomes a huge star.

**portrayal of guilt** play the good kind of screamo—not the Hot Topic screamo, but the one that pulls from powerviolence and grindcore and sounds punishing while still maintaining a groove. even my girlfriend—who absolutely hates this kind of thing—admitted to me that this song "would be good if they didn't make it sound so bad." [let pain be your guide](https://portrayalofguilt.com/album/let-pain-be-your-guide) was one of my favorite aggressive releases last year, and (imho) this just sounds bigger and better.

<br />

**elvis depressedly** is the king of indie pop music, imho. his back catalog with [coma cinema](https://comacinema.bandcamp.com/), [elvis depressedly](https://elvisdepressedly.bandcamp.com/), [gremlins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ5XPKGe7g0), and [solo](https://mathewleecothran.bandcamp.com) are probably deeper and stronger than your underground fave's, and on top of that he's also personally responsible for turning me onto dozens of other bands, including alex g and teen suicide. i wish he was a million times more famous. his new single continues to expand and refine his approach to piling whimsy and pop sensibilities onto a foundation of harsh and gritty themes.

<br />

**black midi** are some youngsters from London who play wild and edgy experimental rock. this record technically came out in june, but didn't really sink in for me till this month. they're kinda technical and traffic more in energy than hooks, but it's a fun ride once you get into it.

### your mileage may vary 

**midsommar** was such a kick ass movie, and i've been listening to the soundtrack a lot while working. i guess i just assumed the haxan cloak guy disappeared, so i was very happy to see he's still doing his thing.

<br />

**alex g** has a new single that sounds so much like a throwback to some [race](https://sandy.bandcamp.com/album/race)-era guitar tracks, but with more of the full band adding weight. i'm into it.

<br />

alex g also apparently helped produce the new glitterer record. **glitterer** is the solo effort from [title fight](https://titlefightmusic.bandcamp.com/album/hyperview)'s ned russin, and it's kinda great?

**sheer mag** put out another crowd pleaser.

<br />

**mal blum** was a new discovery for me, but *pity boy* is full of the kind of rolling pop-punk that ages well with repeat listens.

<br />

**joanna sternberg** put out a record of soft, catchy pop gems that i'm looking forward to revisiting as the leaves change later this year.

<br />

**uniform & the body** teamed up last year for ["mental wounds not healing,"](https://uniformthebody.bandcamp.com/album/mental-wounds-not-healing) and the collab went so well i guess they're already doing it again. "penance" is what you'd expect—pulsing, throbbing, grimy noise that will find a way to sound catchy if you let it.
