*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of september in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

**angel olsen** can do no wrong. this rules.

<br />

further evidence of **hovvdy**'s impending glo-up: this song is so, so good.

**danny brown** is one of the better people there is. i originally got into his *xxx* for how weird it sounded, like it was a punk album as much as it was hip hop. he's got a new one coming out that was produced by q-tip and seems like a more straightforward rap album, but so far it sounds like an instant classic.

<br />

**jpegmafia** also makes punk rock raps, but instead of taking inspiration from joy division like danny brown did, it's more like actual hard core. his new record is less of an homage to death grips—it's kinda all over the place. it makes a mess of more conventional beats, cutting them up into weird jagged collages. it's extremely good.

<br />

**alex g**'s new album is good, and once i've listened 100 more times or so i'll probably tell you it's great.

### suggested, not required

**mount eerie** has a new album coming out. he's collabing with julie doiron, and it seems like a return to the old mount eerie—in case the "dead wife" records were a little to bleak, you might be into this.

**sean henry** was playing bass when i saw trace mountains last year, and (i only recently learned) is also responsible for [boy crush](https://birdtapes.bandcamp.com/album/split-7-2), who had a split 7" with starry cat (one of sam ray's many projects, which also include ricky eat acid and teen suicide). sean henry put out another record last year, [fink](https://saintseanhenry.bandcamp.com/track/the-ants), which double double whammy put out on cassette. they're handling the release of this new one too. he put out two singles this month: the beck-indebted ["surf song"](https://youtu.be/nw0qLdFchTY), and my personal favorite, "rain rain."

<br />

**charli xcx** is a reliable source of pop hits. this record is only this low in the list because it's mostly a reminder to myself to listen to it.

### your mileage may vary

**red death** play the cool kind of metal that combines hardcore and thrash metal, and this new song absolutely rips.

<br />

**julien chang** was a new discovery this month, but "memory loss" has some real toro y moi vibes and i'll for sure be checking out more.

**mary lattimore** did that [collab with mac mccaughan (of superchunk fame)](https://threelobed.bandcamp.com/album/new-rain-duets) earlier this year, that's how i found out about her. "quintana" is a solo effort, mostly harp and synths, but it swirls around in my head and helps me find a focus, whether i'm working or just wandering around my house not remembering why i got up in the first place. really good stuff.

<br />

**weakened friends** have been making nervy pop punk for a few years, but i'll admit not really paying much attention till this new single, which is really good.

<br />

**lil nas x** has more than one song, of course. i'll admit the first time i heard "panini" i thought it was boring, but when i watch this video i'm... pretty into it?
