*Here's a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/kylesparks/playlist/2rvf4k216dEXPRIaUFqwKh?si=x7zJmHz5SdW6r2GOqIu8cA) of all my most favorite songs from 2017.*

My 2018 horoscope said I should share more, so here are the 17 things I listened to most in 2017 and that also came out in 2017, in alphabetical order. It’s pretty much the same as everyone else’s list. In the interest of “paying it forward” or whatever I’ll also try to mention where I heard about each of them.

This is missing a lot of good records I haven’t listened to that much, a lot of not-good records that I’ve listened to an appropriate number of times, and probably some other things I loved but just forgot. <3
<br />

[**(Sandy) Alex G** - *Rocket*](https://sandy.bandcamp.com/album/rocket)

I found out about Alex G from Mat Cothran’s Twitter or Tumblr feed like six years ago. One of my all-time fave songwriters.
<br />
<br />

[**Apollo Vermouth** - *Crashing Into Nowhere*](https://apollovermouth.bandcamp.com/album/crashing-into-nowhere-3)

Alex Stauder introduced me to so many great bands that I’ve probably forgotten more than I remember. Case in point: he introduced me to Apollo Vermouth when the three of us got dinner together before a Pure X show like five years ago, but I’d forgotten about that till after the cassette showed up in the mail and I saw his name in the liner notes. R.I.P. Alex.
<br />
<br />

[**Bell Witch** - *Mirror Reaper*](https://bellwitch.bandcamp.com/album/mirror-reaper)

I probly heard about this from Stereogum. I only really listen to it while I’m working, but I work a lot so it stays on pretty heavy rotation.
<br />
<br />

[**Big Thief** - *Capacity*](https://bigthief.bandcamp.com/album/capacity)

I got super into that first Big Thief album because I was looking for something that sounded like Land of Talk. Then Land of Talk got back together and put out a new album this year, but I’m not that into it cos they don’t sound enough like Big Thief. Saw them at Millennium Park this summer and I thought they were v good. 
<br />
<br />

[**Charly Bliss** - *Guppy*](https://charlybliss.bandcamp.com/album/guppy)

Saw them open for Pup a year or two ago and then they just kept writing better songs.
<br />
<br />

[**Converge** - *The Dusk In Us*](https://convergecult.bandcamp.com/album/the-dusk-in-us)

Converge has been the best forever, but I didn’t learn about them till I started working in a warehouse in like 2011. They’re basically responsible for all the shitty hardcore I listen to these days.
<br />
<br />

[**Couch Slut** - *Contempt*](https://gileadmedia.bandcamp.com/album/contempt)

Maybe Noisey? I don’t remember what first introduced me, I just remember getting knocked on my ass as soon as I heard it. 
<br />
<br />

[**Dark Thoughts** - *Dark Thoughts*](https://dark-thoughts.bandcamp.com/album/dark-thoughts)

Stereogum. This technically came out in 2016, but I didn't know about it then, and it's getting a pass because it's probably the album I listened to most in 2017. Part of that is because it’s the best Ramones-worship pop punk I’ve heard, and the other part is because it’s like 18 minutes long.
<br />
<br />

[**Florist** - *If Blue Could Be Happiness*](https://florist.bandcamp.com/album/if-blue-could-be-happiness)

I try to listen to everything Double Double Whammy puts out. 
<br />
<br />

[**Grouper** - *Paradise Valley 7”*](https://grouper.bandcamp.com/album/paradise-valley)

Another Alex Stauder intro from back when we were in college and he was trying to sell me on why he quit garage rock and started a bunch of ambient/drone projects. Grouper was the first group he sent me that broke through, and she’s still my favorite.
<br />
<br />

[**Jay Som** - *Everybody Works*](https://jaysom.bandcamp.com/album/everybody-works)

Probly Stereogum or something, I don’t remember. If there’s anyone writing better guitar-pop songs than Alex G right now I think it might be Melina Duterte.
<br />
<br />

[**Lomelda** - *Thx*](https://lomelda.bandcamp.com/album/thx-4)

Another Double Double Whammy record. I’ve listened to this probly every Sunday morning since it came out.
<br />
<br />

[**Melkbelly** - *Nothing Valley*](https://melkbelly.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-valley)

Hard to go to shows in Chicago without bumping into at least a couple Melkbelly sets. They’re probly the best Chicago band going rn imho.
<br />
<br />

[**Open City** - *Open City*](https://theeopencity.bandcamp.com/album/open-city)

Mannequin Pussy didn’t put out an album this year, but this made up for it—super noisy and hooky, with this huge voice wailing over the top. I first checked them out when Stereogum said Ted Leo's drummer was in a new band.
<br />
<br />

[**Priests** - *Nothing Feels Natural*](https://priests.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-feels-natural)

I got sucked into Priests back when all the blawgs were writing about their first demo. They were really good at articulating a lot of political ideas I was just starting to understand, and they were also really good at writing great hooks. This record rules.
<br />
<br />

[**Show Me The Body** - *K-9 7”*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lbhTLeoUCs)

Fader, I think. Body War didn't really do it for me, but they started playing banjo again and I am all the way back in. Another band whose politics factor into (or, uh, amplify) their appeal for me.
<br />
<br />

[**Vagabon** - *Infinite Worlds*](https://vagabon.bandcamp.com/album/infinite-worlds)

Probly Stereogum, and probly tied with Jay Som for my favorite discovery of 2017.
<br />
<br />


## Honorable Mention:
[**Bonny Doon** - *Bonny Doon*](https://bonnydoon.bandcamp.com/album/bonny-doon-lp)
<br />
<br />

[**Cave Curse** - *Future Dust*](https://cavecurse.bandcamp.com/album/future-dust)

This is still growing on me, but Bobby Hussy doesn't make bad music, and I'm pretty stoked on the darkwave stuff he's been getting into the past few years.
<br />
<br />

[**Kehlani** - *SweetSexySavage*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4B4in9QlrlYWSHlYSRebdC?si=vD-j2QiRRjuuJWWLFEoPUA)

I wanna say I heard this on rec from my pal Jillian, but I don’t know. This was my favorite album for like a month but then I just sort of forgot about it, I donno.
<br />
<br />

[**Mount Eerie** - *A Crow Looked At Me*](https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/a-crow-looked-at-me)
<br />
<br />

[**Pile** - *A Hairshirt of Purpose*](https://pile.bandcamp.com/album/a-hairshirt-of-purpose)

I heard about Pile from being a Krill fanboy in like 2010 or 2011. Not my favorite Pile record, not my least favorite Pile record.
<br />
<br />

[**The Spirit of the Beehive** - *Pleasure Suck*](https://thespiritofthebeehive.bandcamp.com/album/pleasure-suck-2)

I guess I must've been bored the day Tiny Engines sent out a mailer about this record, but I'm pretty into how weird this band gets without ever doing anything that _sounds_ weird. It's just a bunch of catchy hooks put into a noise blender.
<br />
<br />

[**Spencer Radcliffe** - *Enjoy The Great Outdoors*](https://spencerradcliffe.bandcamp.com/album/enjoy-the-great-outdoors)

TBH, I thought this came out in 2016. And TBH, I didn’t really care about this at first. I thought it just sounded pleasant, but something about it got me to keep re-listening, and eventually it all just kind of hit me at once.

I think I heard of his other project, Blithe Field, first, after he put out that Warm Blood record, which I still listen to regularly. Probably from Mat Cothran or Sam Ray’s Twitter feed.

[**Vince Staples** - *Big Fish Theory*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5h3WJG0aZjNOrayFu3MhCS?si=Tw9yLpgtRoaRNA_3BR95Gg)
