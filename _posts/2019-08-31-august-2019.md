*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of august in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

i returned from a vacation earlier this month to discover a surprise 7" in the mail. the record and packaging were all blank, and i couldn't remember ordering anything that would fit the description. after pressing play i was pretty sure it sounded like adrienne linker's voice—but **big thief** already put out a great album earlier this year, [ufof](https://open.spotify.com/album/5X0bIKvPtSDo4NpXqgrB6p?si=3uG5GhZ5QHWbkzCout7jCg). Turns out it was [theirs](https://www.stereogum.com/2053777/big-thief-surprise-7-inch/music/) after all, and i guess it was a signal that they've got another album coming. this band is operating at an extremely high level right now.

**great grandpa** put out a record of hooky college rock-type stuff a couple years ago ([this song](https://greatgrandpa.bandcamp.com/track/teen-challenge) is still a bop), but this new song is a totally different swerve. it's pretty, it's catchy, it's all kinds of things i didn't expect.

**hovvdy** write soft and smooth folksy / poppy guitar songs. their back catalog can tend to blend together a bit, but "cathedral," the first song off their forthcoming record, is bigger, fuller, better than anything they've done before. we'll see what the rest of the album sounds like, but i'm hopeful this is one of those times when a good band becomes great.

**empty country** is a new group led by joseph d'agostino, who also leads cymbals eat guitars. cymbals is one of my favorite rock bands of the last 10 years or so, and i'm thrilled to report that this new stuff scratches the same itch.

### suggested, not required

**fire heads** and **sex scenes** are some of the more exciting punk rock bands i've heard of out madison and milwaukee (respectively) in a while, so i'm stoked they put their heads together to release a split album.

**help** are another new punk band i've had on heavy rotation this month. i'm typically wary of any explicitly political music, as it can get pretty cliche and corny pretty quick. but [help](https://helpifuckingneedit.bandcamp.com) strike that balance for me, and sound like classic mclusky. imho, "class war now" is exactly the kind of anthem 2019 needed.

**kim gordon** is releasing her first solo record, which was a surprise to me because it's not like she's been inactive since sonic youth ended. anyway i like this song.

<br />

**brockhampton** released another crowd pleaser. their albums sometimes have a fair amount of filler imho, but their singles are pretty consistently great.

<br />

**jay som** put out another single that's got a very smooth vibe, and a p chill video to boot.

**yeesh** were a great, jittery chicago rock band till they broke up a few years ago—but apparently that breakup came with a full album in the can that's finally seeing release. it's good stuff.
