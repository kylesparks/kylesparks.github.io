*you can check out a playlist with most of my favorite songs from 2019 [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

2020 was the first full year i spent listening to a lot of podcasts, and unsurprisingly it's also the year i have the least interesting takes on new music. 
i was less patient with music that didn't grab me immediately, and spent more time revisiting older music—including the 36 hours spotify says i spent listening to grouper.

i've been trying to catch up on all the websites' best-of lists, and i'm sure i'll eventually find something i love, but for now, these are the albums that made enough of an imprint that i'll keep returning to them in 2020.

## actual favorites
**florist** - [*emily alone*](https://florist.bandcamp.com/album/emily-alone)<br />
**emily a sprague** - [*water memory / mount vision*](https://mlesprg.bandcamp.com/)<br />
whether in a traditional band setting like florist or her solo ambient work, emily sprague is one of the best there is at coaxing vivid and emotive details out of the quietest songs. shouts out to beyoncé for [recognizing it](https://www.stereogum.com/2040366/florist-beyonce-documentary-thank-you-song/news/).

**jeff rosenstock** - [*thanks, sorry!*](https://jeffrosenstock.bandcamp.com/album/thanks-sorry)<br />
this live album somehow feels even more urgent and necessary than his unimpeachable studio albums.

**mannequin pussy** - [*patience*](https://mannequinpussy.bandcamp.com/album/patience)<br />
maybe the world's best punk band had a catchier, more melodic and accessible glo up that still actually rips.

**purple mountains** - [*purple mountains*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5NCdiiTgky5PbjmCtcgwtn?si=rrGocpR3QjiCzdvUOAHOEg)<br />
i still don't have anything smart or insightful to say about this. this album grabbed me the first time i heard it, and then completely broke my heart when david berman passed away one week before i was to see him perform it live. the world can be such a cold and miserable place, and it can also give us art like this. hard to square it.

**strange ranger** - [*remembering the rockets*](https://strangeranger.bandcamp.com/album/remembering-the-rockets)<br />
i want to say this is the album where strange ranger finally came into their own sound, but paradoxically it's the one that sounds the most like their '90s indie rock influences. the thing is, i've spent the last ~20 years listening to those influences, and in a lot of cases i think i like this strange ranger record better.

**truth club** - [*not an exit*](https://truthclub.bandcamp.com/album/not-an-exit)<br />
this was probably my most exciting discovery of the year. it's such a confident sounding record, i was shocked at how young they were when i saw them play at reed's. there were only maybe a half dozen of us there, but they sounded great. very stoked for what they do next.

## tier 2: still pretty good!
**(sandy) alex g** - [*house of sugar*](https://sandy.bandcamp.com/album/house-of-sugar)<br />
spotify determined that alex g was my "artist of the decade," and it's hard to argue against that. i think *house of sugar* is his most complete album and the one i'd tell someone who's never heard of him to start with, though that's a little easier to argue about.

**american pleasure club** - [*fucking bliss*](https://americanpleasureclub.bandcamp.com/album/fucking-bliss-2)<br />
lol this album is absolutely insane and kinda sounds like garbage. it's such a huge change of pace for APC, though it makes a lot of sense within the larger universe of sam ray's work. after striking gold with the magnum opus of meandering indie pop on [*it's the big joyous celebration, let's stir the honeypot*](https://teensuicide.bandcamp.com/album/its-the-big-joyous-celebration-lets-stir-the-honeypot), [*a whole fucking lifetime of this*](https://americanpleasureclub.bandcamp.com/album/a-whole-fucking-lifetime-of-this) had no other option but to feel "kind of the same, but less..." *fucking bliss* is going to turn off a lot of people, but it reeled me all the way back in.

**angel olsen** - [*all mirrors*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0RedX0LZkGUFoRwFntAaI0?si=wgDwHu_zQZuy7d73SNu6gw)<br />
taken as a whole record, *all mirrors* did less for me than angel's other records. even so, there are spots on here—including several different ones just on ["lark"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uaN60k0-zY), like when she jumps straight into the chorus belting "hiding out inside my head / it's me again, it's no surprise / i'm on my own now;" and again later when she rouses a defense, "you say you love / every single part / what about my dreams? / what about my heart?"—... there's just not a lot of people who've ever really been able to do this kind of thing.

**big thief** - [*u.f.o.f.*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5X0bIKvPtSDo4NpXqgrB6p?si=aqrQncGvST2NbiVvoUlwbw) / [*two hands*](https://open.spotify.com/album/7pg8T6pajjHVZbiyB8bGxo?si=0HGtQlRXSxqmfMVYvJ8kCw)<br />
i don't have a lot of interesting things to say about big thief. both of these albums are awesome, and i think i still need to spend more time with them.

**black midi** - [*schlagenheim*](https://bmblackmidi.bandcamp.com/album/schlagenheim)<br />
i saw black midi play in new york for more than 90 minutes straight, with several extended jam-y interludes, and i could've sat through another couple hours. it's tough to capture the frenetic energy that makes them special on a coherent album, but *schlagenheim* is pretty close.

**blood incantation** - [*hidden history of the human race*](https://darkdescentrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-history-of-the-human-race)<br />
this was the crossover death metal album i never knew i needed. 

**dark thoughts** - [*must be nice*](https://dark-thoughts.bandcamp.com/album/must-be-nice)<br />
no band is more reliable with the 90 second catchy-as-hell ramones-esque punk rock than these guys.

**frail body** - [*a brief memoriam*](https://frailbodyil.bandcamp.com/album/a-brief-memoriam)<br />
screamo from rockford, illinois. on a different day, i might've bumped this up into the "actually favorites" section. 

**jpegmafia** - [*all my heroes are cornballs*](https://jpegmafia.bandcamp.com/album/all-my-heroes-are-cornballs)<br />
there were a lot of great rap albums this year, but i didn't hear any as chaotic and fun as this one. kind of like some of the old danny brown stuff, this is essentially a punk album with a rapper on it.

**julia jacklin** - [*crushing*](https://juliajacklin.bandcamp.com/album/crushing)<br />
this is just a fully formed, well-executed pop record. it spans a range of sounds and emotions, and i spent a lot of the summer with it on loop.

[*snaketime: the music of moondog*](https://astrallaurenzi.bandcamp.com/album/snaketime-the-music-of-moondog)<br />
i don't listen to a lot of jazz, but this dominated my rotation for several weeks and still feels fresh and exciting listening back. 

**nivhek** - [*after its own death / walking in a spiral towards the house*](https://grouper.bandcamp.com/album/after-its-own-death-walking-in-a-spiral-towards-the-house)<br />
what's wild about spotify telling me i spent 36 hours listening to grouper, is it didn't even include the dozens of times i listened to this, another great liz harris project.

**palehound** - [*black friday*](https://palehound.bandcamp.com/album/black-friday)<br />
there are songs on [her last LP](https://palehound.bandcamp.com/album/a-place-ill-always-go) that might dig a bit deeper, but this album is good as hell, and feels better suited for the bigger rooms she's starting to play. i love it.

**pup** - [*morbid stuff*](https://open.spotify.com/album/504XSXhUJlzztcMV4YMaDV?si=FJSSU5WpR8eKWiAqUozhnQ)<br />
in a few years (months? weeks?), i might look back on this list and fail to recognize the writer who thought pup was anything other than the best band in the world.

## podcasts

since podcasts took up as much attention as albums in my 2019 listening, here's a quick list of the podcasts i liked the most:

**intercepted** is jeremy scahill's weekly reported work. he has a lot of great guests and covers a wide range of issues domestic and international. makes a dumb guy like me feel smart sometimes.

**trillbilly worker's party** is a group of three folx in appalachia who get together and shoot the shit from eastern kentucky. i think they're hilarious and one of my can't-miss pods, but sometimes they're also pretty bleak. your mileage may vary.

**trueanon** is about jeffrey epstein and the broader project of taking down the pedos who carry outsized influence in the world. that kinda topic is extremely "my shit," and brace belden is maybe the funniest guy there is.

**the bruenigs** is the matt-and-liz duo explaining current events and whatnot. personally, i think they're great.

**radio war nerd** is gary brecher and mark ames' show about wars. the episodes get pretty long as they often get pretty in the weeds about things i know nothing about, but it's always informative and good. when you support their patreon they also send out newsletters that are often great.

**the vast majority** is micah uetricht (jacobin managing editor) who often brings on guests to explain new books or introduce new candidates running on socialist platforms.

**foreign exchanges** is derek davison's podcast on, well, foreign affairs. there are free episodes, but you can also subscribe to his substack for more episodes and also a regular email that provides pretty dense recap in the day in the world.
