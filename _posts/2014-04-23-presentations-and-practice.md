Garr Reynolds’ Presentation Zen is a 221-page, text-heavy book that explains how strong visuals and concise narratives can be more effective at conveying messages than wordy ramblings. 

Guy Kawasaki took that advice and crafted the book's Foreword out of PowerPoint slides, demonstrating some of the lessons Reynolds was about to lay down. He’s not the first person to try to tell a story this way. Probably the most famous example of this narrative device comes from Jennifer Egan, who wrote an entire chapter in [A Visit From The Goon Squad](http://www.amazon.com/Visit-Goon-Squad-Jennifer-Egan/dp/0307477479) in PowerPoint slides. I thought that chapter (and the book as a whole) was brilliant for committing so wholly to each narrator’s voice while continuing to tell a captivating story; but that chapter remains highly controversial in literary circles, in no small part because the book won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. 

So I approached Presentation Zen understanding that PowerPoint slides—though risky—could be used for good. Unfortunately, Reynolds employed less successful storytelling devices in his lessons about them. One of these lessons was particularly disappointing, so I’m going to unpack it a little more here.

Chapter 8 is called “The Art of Being Completely Present,” and begins to address the real-world implications of a zen-based, or meditative lifestyle. The edition I read was published in 2008, so we can forgive Reynolds for missing the obvious [Based God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_B) tie-ins. But the examples Reynolds did incorporate dealt more with zen’s ambiguous nature than anything tangible (or useful).

He mentions swordsmen, judo masters, and orchestra members as three examples of performers who can have a “mind of no mind”—which is to say, a sober mind that’s numb to extraneous stimuli. The ideal here is just a performer who can make any technical, learned practice look natural and uninhibited. 

The best athletes do this all the time. Elite athletes will talk about being “in the zone”—a magically serene place in which the world stops spinning, and nothing exists except you and your supreme athleticism. 

But in the five pages of text devoted to articulating this concept, Reynolds never revealed the science behind the phenomenon. And truthfully, it’s hardly a phenomenon. It’s not magic; it’s an observable and testable reality. 

[One of the more well-known studies](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2010/09/21/psychologist-shows-why-we-choke-under-pressure-and-how-avoid-it) of this comes from a psychologist named Sian Beilock at the University of Chicago. One of her numerous studies on the topic involved golfers making putts with various amounts of pressure and distraction. Turns out, putters who had practiced the putt beforehand were significantly better at making their putt if they were asked to perform an additional task as a distraction, like whistling.

What we can conclude from this study and others like it is that our working memories (short-term) can oftentimes work against us. Under pressure, we’re better off defaulting to our internalized habits and knowledge, because those are more stable and predictable. When we begin to use our working memory to self-analyze every minor thought and motion, we lose grasp of the bigger picture and deny ourselves any advantage we might have gained through practice. 

We commonly refer to these advantages as “muscle memory,” and we internalize work into muscle memory through repeated, deliberate practice. A swordsman is only able to free his mind during a performance because he has performed the technique enough times that he doesn’t need to think about it any more. Same with the judo master and the elite athlete. To draw back to Reynolds’ point: With enough practice, a great presentation might seem like it just presents itself. But if this phenomenon feels magical, surreal, and unfamiliar, it is in fact quite the opposite. In reality, nothing is more familiar to you—that’s how you’re in control. It's not magic; it's practice.
