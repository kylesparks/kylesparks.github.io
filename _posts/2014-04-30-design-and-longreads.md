title: Design and Longreads

I read one of the cooler longreads I'd read in a while Monday night. It had basically everything you could want in a longread: a drug kingpin! in a thrilling chase sequence! and sexual exploits! twists! turns! international intrigue!

It was awesome. Here is what one of the more exciting passages looked like while I was reading it:

Hopefully that helps illustrate what has been one of the core tensions in my writing-based UX Apprenticeship 8th Light. I'm learning to think about the design of words, but in my own real life I go to great lengths to avoid design when reading words. 

I have both a [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) and an [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) account, and both do the work of transferring a piece of writing from a unique page into a normalized layout with normalized font. They frequently miss transferring images and videos, but that doesn't bother me much. Unlike the vast majority of Internet users, when I open a new web page, I frequently want to see nothing but a massive block of text. 

That's being slightly disingenuous, because in reality Pocket and Instapaper both engage in forms of web design that appeal to my interests. By normalizing font and layout, they're optimizing legibility. The screenshot above was much easier to read on my phone (and also, coincidentally, on the train) because of some very real effort in web design.

But this can take away from more active web designs that could improve a story. The obvious example of this is [New York Times' "Snowfall" article](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/?forceredirect=yes#/?part=tunnel-creek), which has a stunning graphic design accompanying what I found to be a rather dull story (although revisiting it now, I realize the design is not as responsive as I'd remembered). Honestly, the design might be too good. Much of the story was uninteresting on its own, and better told through the graphic elements. I don't know whether it was over-designed or under-reported, I only know that I resented it for the imbalance.

Regardless, other newspapers and magazines have tried to copy this without NYT's design team, and frequently to even worse results. 

Specifically, I'm thinking of this story that I read recently in Charlotte Magazine about the mysterious death of a police officer, ["Shadows By The Sea."](http://www.charlottemagazine.com/Charlotte-Magazine/April-2014/Shadows-by-the-Sea/?src=longreads) It was excellently reported and told. But when you open the link to read it, the window will automatically (annoyingly) begin playing a rather generic audio track of waves crashing on a beach. As if the prose didn't do a good enough job of explaining that the death took place on an island. I read it in my Pocket instead, which didn't copy the audio links, and I felt like the story was better for it.

But the sports website SB Nation has been much more successful at more innovative layouts. The most recent example that comes to mind is [this story about "bag men"](http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/4/10/5594348/college-football-bag-man-interview?src=longreads) around NCAA football teams in the SEC. Every section is designed like a new page, though still feeling integrated to the whole by an aesthetic theme. The pages just sort of glide together as you uncover more and more details about these rich men of questionable ethics. One minute you'll think they're corrupt, and at another you'll think they're modern-day Robin Hoods. The pages change with the emotions, and the window is beautifully responsive.

SB Nation has done several other great stories like this, and it's obvious that they have a team that really cares about working together; making stories worthy of great design, and designs tailored to fit the stories.

But I still don't think there's a design team at any newspaper, website, or magazine that operates at a level quite as high as the one at New York Times. That showed up again last night when I finally got around to reading John Jeremiah Sullivan's ["The Ballad of Geeshie and Elvie."](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/13/magazine/blues.html?hp&_r=0&smid=tw-share) Per usual, Jeremiah Sullivan's reporting and prose are spotless.

And unlike the "Snowfall" scenario in which the design team overtook the story, this layout does an awesome job of letting the text breathe. There are several hero-sized videos and images that pop out of the grid to help shine a light on different revelations in the story. The page fades into and out of the videos as you scroll into and out of them, and the audio doesn't start until you click for it to. They're even responsive, and stay centered with shadows filling out the break-points as you re-size your window.

But I think my favorite little design feature was the more subtle examples of audio embedded inside of paragraphs. Little "Play" icons sit inside; and when you press play, the audio track fills out the specific text it's set to highlight.

I wouldn't have wanted to read this in my Pocket or Instapaper interfaces, because they would have denied me integral pieces to the story. But these features didn't draw my attention away from the prose, either. It was a perfect balance of understated-though-innovative design helping to prop a story that hardly needed it in the first place.
