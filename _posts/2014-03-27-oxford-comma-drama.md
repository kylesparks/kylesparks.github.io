In my last post, I briefly touched on the debate over when we decide to simplify language. The AP Style Guide had just begun to allow “over” in replace of “more than,” and it recalled a memory of the time the same Style Guide dropped the hyphen in email. I argued in favor of these changes, as they seemed to follow along with the general evolution of conversations.

But the evolutionary arc isn’t so clear with the Oxford comma. The AP Style Guide contends that Oxford commas are unnecessary and should be eliminated in order to save space. I disagree.

As an exercise in grammatical anthropology, this conversation should start at the comma’s origin. According to Lynne Truss’ Eats, Shoots & Leaves, the earliest known punctuation is credited to Aristophanes around 200 BC. Aristophanes employed a three-tiered system of notation that dictated the length of pause an orator should employ at each break.

We see this carried over into modern musical notation. Musicians place “luftpauses” at the tops of their lines of sheet music at the places where they should take breaths or restart a bow stroke. In the earliest days of writing when language was shared almost exclusively through oration, commas served an identical purpose.

And according to a recent column on Lit Reactor, the comma as we’ve come to know it was first inserted into religious text around A.D. 400 when St. Augustine became frustrated with the inconsistent way people had taken to reading the Bible out loud.

But it wasn’t until printing was popularized in the 14th and 15th centuries that punctuation really began to flourish. That’s when a guy named Aldus Manutius came around in the late 1400’s and really turned the game on its head. According to Eats, Shoots & Leaves, Manutius created not only the italic typeface, but also the semicolon! Chill Bro Alert is in full effect.

Manutius’ son, also named Aldus, carried on his father’s craft, and in 1566 claimed that “the main object of punctuation was the clarification of syntax” (again credited to Eats, Shoots & Leaves).

So far as I can tell, that’s the point at which the comma officially transitioned from having an auditory intent to asserting a more visual purpose. The audience transitioned from listeners to active readers, and so grammar evolved to more appropriately accommodate them.

The comma adopted other purposes too, all tangentially related to the concept behind a pause. Commas team with conjunctions to combine related clauses that should flow together without a period between them, fill in the gaps for clauses that are safely assumed, separate prose from direct speech, set off interjections from normal tone, distinguish clauses that contain additional information, and separate items in a list.

In all of these cases the comma asserts itself as an essential tool to fine-tune rhythm and comprehension.

But it’s not the only one.

In fact, sometimes the absence of a comma does even more.

Ernest Hemingway is one of my favorite examples of this phenomenon. By replacing commas with “and”s, he could more dramatically illustrate the ways his characters might be anxious and unsuspecting and embarrassed and possibly angry but definitely yearning for a drink. That sentence is grammatically correct because commas are really just placeholders for conjunctions in a list, much the same way apostrophes are placeholders for unspoken letters in contractions. Both commas and apostrophes are there to streamline a writer’s ability to produce and a reader’s ability to consume, but (at least in the cases of lists and contractions) they aren’t required. We’ve grown into commas; we can grow out of them, too.

But this very multifaceted-ness can complicate a writer’s decision about whether to use one or not. Take the following example, again taken from Eats, Shoots & Leaves:

“They tell us to slow down, notice this, take a detour, and stop.”

The intent of writing this list of instructions is unrelated to the intent behind the Oxford comma, yet they overlap here in a way that creates confusion. Without the Oxford comma, the meaning of the last clause changes.

This leads me to my final conclusion, again gleaned from Truss’ excellent book. On page 96, she asks that her readers “don’t use commas like a stupid person.” Stupid people need instructions to be black and white, but commas embrace shades of gray.

By consistently employing Oxford commas, we can reduce the risk of misrepresenting our message. And in my opinion, that risk management is of paramount importance. But at the same time, if the clarity and value inherent in your writing hinges on such a minuscule instrument designed only for fine-tuning, it’s worth considering whether your sentence might benefit from more than just a fine-tuning.
