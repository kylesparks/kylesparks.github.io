title: Breaking Dictums and Finding Katas

One thing I’ve been trying to emphasize this first week is taking writing from a fluid and easy process to a more rigid and challenging one. I should be thinking more critically about what I’m writing before I write it, or at least improve my ability to analyze and edit the things I’ve already written. That’s the old writing dictum, “All writing is rewriting.”

That’s just one of the many dictums that novelist and New York Times journalist Ethan Hauser tackled in a recent essay called “Baffling Dictums: On the Rules of Writing.”

Suffice it to say he’s not a big fan. He still writes first drafts on a yellow legal pad, which I’ve taken to doing as well, but otherwise he only advocates one real lesson:

“The most indelible writing exercise I was ever taught was to copy, either by typing or by hand, a favorite piece of prose,” he writes. “I don’t recall the professor’s explanation about the assignment, yet I know that it must have been so we could hear the music in the sentences, the sound and the rhythm, the difference a comma makes, the impact of a short word versus a longer one. She wanted us to appreciate the architecture and choreography of a paragraph.”

A lot of programmers around the 8th Light office talk about Katas. They’re exercises derived from the classic Japanese Katas, designed to emphasize and refine muscle memory and technique to the point at which they can be taken for granted during a larger performance. While programmers often talk about system architecture and logic in their work, when they talk about Katas they talk about keystrokes and command shortcuts. They work on the technicalities and mechanics of working in a language and on a computer.

So the obvious question for me has been to figure out how I could incorporate Katas to improve my writing mechanics. Not just keystrokes and spelling, but how can I more closely scrutinize the synergy of words, sentences, paragraphs, and the grammar that separates them?

In essence, what I’ve been looking for is exactly the practice that Hauser describes. I want to be able to more closely “hear the music in the sentences, the sound and the rhythm, the difference a comma makes, the impact of a short word versus a longer one.” I want to more fully “appreciate the architecture and choreography of a paragraph” such that I can recreate them on my own.

Hauser’s practice is somewhat of an anti-dictum. He views the practice of copying classic prose as an opportunity to figure out which risks to take, which dictums to break. So I’m going to start experimenting with that. I’ll start by revisiting long-form articles I’ve favorited in either my Instapaper or Pocket accounts, and write out some of their more memorable passages. I’ll find out which dictums they used, which dictums they broke, and why it left such a strong impression on me. It’s not exactly the same as the programmers’ Katas, but it’s still a practice that emphasizes a fundamental aspect of the process.
