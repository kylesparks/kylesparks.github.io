*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of october in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

since david berman died earlier this year, i've listened to dozens (hundreds?) of covers made in tribute to the late genius. **stef chura**'s version of "how to rent a room" is probably the only one i've actually liked.

when i was in middle school and high school, one of the better ways i sought out new music was following late night talk shows. if someone i was excited about was coming on, i'd set up the VCR and tape the performance so i could go back and re-watch it till it came out on CD and i could officially own it.

it was a pretty low hit-rate. and even when a song sounded catchy enough, it was extremely rare that a band's performance—constrained to a television set, within a television box—could actually do something to me. **big thief** playing "not" is one of those rare performances that would've had me carrying around the VHS copy to show all my friends their new favorite band.

bad news: cymbals eat guitars, one of my favorite ever bands and maybe the most underrated of the last decade, are officially donezo. good news: **empty country**, the new project by CEG frontman Joseph D'Agostino, has a new album coming out. previous singles were maybe a little more in-line with the CEG catalog (["ultrasound"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IvWwRmkzHQ) with the edge-of-your-seat guitar hooks they perfected on *lose*; ["jets"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS3PgR7d5HM) with the more meditative noodling that helped pace *why there are mountains*), but while "marian" is a bit different, it's still good, breezy listening. i'll be stoked for everything this guy does forever.

**jeff rosenstock** is a living legend, and this month he put out two compelling-but-very-different releases. "thanks, sorry!" is a live album, stitched together from a run of shows he did in each of new york's buroughs. his studio records are all amazing, but his live shows are can't-miss material and this collection feels very necessary.

<br />

rosenstock also released an ambient song, titled "ambient 7," which makes me hope he has at least six more of these things lying around because i love it.

### suggested, not required
**destroyer** is putting out a new record, and the lead single finds a way to thread the needle between the groovy [kaputt](https://destroyer.bandcamp.com/album/kaputt) rhythms and the soft disco-verging build-up in [bay of pigs](https://destroyer.bandcamp.com/album/bay-of-pigs). destroyer has never made a bad record, but i'm especially stoked to hear a record full of songs like this.

**dark thoughts** are maybe the most reliable source of short, catchy, ramones-worship punk songs going right now. supposedly they're releasing their third LP in january, and this 7" is just to keep us going in the meantime.

<br />

**illuminati hotties** haven't announced a follow-up to the extremely catchy and fun [kiss yr frenemies](https://illuminatihotties.bandcamp.com/album/kiss-yr-frenemies), but "ppl plzr" is a standalone track that doesn't feel tossed off. it's hooky and fun and this band is very good.

i didn't realize **dan deacon** was still out there doing his thing, so it was a welcome to surprise to hear he's got a new album coming out. the first single, "sat by a tree," is infectious stuff.

**car talk** are a new discovery for me, and this song "wrestling" has me stoked to learn more. really catchy power pop that i didn't really realize i was missing.

**frances quinlan** is singer/guitarist for hop along, and now planning on releasing her first solo effort. it doesn't sound too different from hop along's last record, which i'm saying as a compliment. the tracklist claims the forthcoming album will end with a cover of built to spill's "carry the zero" 0_0
