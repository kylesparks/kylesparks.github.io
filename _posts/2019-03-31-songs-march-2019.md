*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of march in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

**old town road** is the best song i'll ever hear. can't nobody tell me nothin'.

<br />

close runner-up is the **tethered mix of "i got 5 on it"**. us was great, and the soundtrack played a big part in making it even better than get out, imho.

<br />

i've also had a hard time turning off this new song from **truth club**. tiny engines puts out all kinds of cool indie guitar rock (also see: spirit of the beehive, hotelier, strange ranger, illuminati hotties, last month's entry club night). i like the vibe of this one. the guitar tones make them come off like if preoccupations weren't so damn self-serious.

### suggested, not required

**brutus** play loud post-hardcore that sometimes gets fairly orchestral for a three-piece—it's great, but my favorite on their new LP, [nest](https://wearebrutus.bandcamp.com/album/nest), is the shit-ripper "cemetery," which sounds like it could be a classic white lung track.

<br />

**dustin laurenzi** used to play in cool punk and ska bands when we were in high school together, but now he plays sax in a bunch of jazz outfits, including twin talk, which put out a great record last month—[*weaver*](https://twintalk.bandcamp.com/album/weaver), which i neglected to include in the round-up. this month he's releasing *snaketime: the music of moondog*. i learned via googling that [moondog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moondog) was an eccentric street performer in new york from the 40s into the 70s, who created weird instruments and wrote cool, catchy, jazzy stuff. i've started digging into moondog's collected works on spotify and it's all good, but i've been really enjoying dustin's interpretations as both a good introduction to the man and also just a really good, cohesive record.

**caracara** are putting out a 7" produced by will yip soon, and this new song is very much *my shit*. this is the kind of emo i'm looking to pay a dollar to hear on the touchtunes after a half dozen adult beverages. i'm still making up my mind on last year's [**summer megalith**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0G7I8dJyYs), but there are a few songs on there that will still randomly pop up and get stuck in my head out of nowhere. i think this band is very good.

<br />

**spencer radcliffe** deserves to be way more famous. in addition to his eponymous band's silver jews-inspired folk-rock, he also puts out some of my favorite ambient music as blithe field. *ward unbending* is just as rich and engrossing as any of his records. he just puts this stuff out with no fuss or fanfare all the time.

## your mileage may vary

in addition to running orchid tapes, warren hildebrand makes really smooth ambient-leaning pop as **foxes in fiction**. i guess *ontario sunshine pt. 3* didn't make the cut for his next record, which means his next record is probably going to be pretty dense.

<br />

and i've also enjoyed the ambient stylings of **mac mccaughan** on this duo with **mary lattimore**, *new rain duets*. i like this record on its own quite a bit, and it also got me to go back and listen to mary lattimore's harp stuff.

i've been spending the workdays exposing myself to more american primitive guitar stuff, so this new bill mackay record, *fountain fire* was some neat timing.

<br />

i saw **greys** play in the threadless warehouse maybe seven years ago, and i've been pretty into everything they've done since. "these things happen" does a good job of mixing all the things they do best—guitars, drums, guitars, etc.

and lastly, not really a song, but there's no bigger news in 2019 than a [**potential krill reunion**](https://www.stereogum.com/2035138/krill-regroup-as-obstacle/news/).
