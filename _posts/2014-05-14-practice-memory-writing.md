Malcolm Gladwell’s become a convenient punching bag in recent years. He’s a science writer, so his job is to make very complex concepts sound very simple. But sometimes that leads him to present scientific evidence as anecdotal instead of empirical. 

One such example is the 10,000 hour principle, which he wrote about in his best-selling book Outliers. The principle actually comes from a 40-year-old paper in American Scientist by Herbert Simon and William Chase, and is simply the idea that there are no instant experts; any complex field requires an individual to practice roughly 10,000 hours before becoming an expert. 

This conclusion isn’t pseudo-science, but it is heavily anecdotal. In Outliers, Gladwell used composers, chess grandmasters, and the popular rock ’n’ roll band the Beatles as support. Some people have taken issue with this.

In an excerpt from the newly published Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning, authors Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, and Mark A. McDaniel present an alternative. They say that instead of quantity, it’s the quality of practice that matters. Specifically, they call out three different classifications of practice: spaced, interleaved, and varied. 

The benefits of these types of practice have been observed in surgery, football, and college students’ knowledge retention; but they presented a fourth example in this excerpt that really stood out.

In this study, kids were broken into two groups. One of those groups practiced throwing a ball into a bucket placed three feet away from them. The second group practiced for the same amount of time, but alternated between throwing a ball into a bucket two feet away and another placed four feet away. After the practice period was over, both groups were tested on their ability to throw a ball into the bucket placed three feet away. Surprisingly, the group that had thrown into the two-foot and four-foot buckets (but never the three-foot) performed significantly better. 

Without trudging too deep into the mechanics: recent neuroimaging studies have lent further evidence suggesting there is a scientific reason for this. 

This is a groundbreaking development in the way we think about long-term memory. While we used to think we could just drill something into our working memory deep enough that it would remain engrained in our longterm memory, now we can think about that transfer process more like bundling together what are otherwise disparate neuron connections. And when we think about practice, we can think about it more like tying knots and less like kicking tires—the type of practice can matter more than the amount.

I still take issue with the excerpt’s title, though (if you didn’t click through above, it’s “Ditch the 10,000 hour rule! Why Malcolm Gladwell’s famous advice falls short”), mainly because I don’t think the 10,000 hour principle was ever really meant to stand on its own (and Gladwell suggests as much in this defense). Rather, I think the authors of Make It Stick are not arguing with Gladwell so much as supplementing him. It will still likely take about 10,000 hours to master a complex skill, but now we know more about what to do in those 10,000 hours.

The type of practice you do can dictate whether your gained knowledge is simply case-specific or broadly applicable. You don’t want to be confident just in your ability to throw a ball into a bucket at a certain distance, but in your ability to throw a ball into a bucket, period.

To that end, I spent a good part of yesterday reading interviews and advice about writing from people who predominantly write fiction. I read an article about Pixar’s Braintrust, a collection of advice compiled by Joe Fassler in the Atlantic, and a story about Gordon Lish’s fiction workshops that eventually led me to this Paris Review interview with one of my favorite fiction writers, Amy Hempel.

Hempel has a journalism background, and talked about how that’s influenced the way she constructs stories. But she also said something else in the interview that I found interesting:

“Some writers have a more defined sense of course and effect. Plot. My sense of life is more moment, moment, and moment. Looking back, they accrue and occur to you at a certain time and maybe you don’t know why, but you trust that they are coming back to you now for a reason. And you make a leap of faith. You trust that you can put these moments together and create a story.”

That sounds like how my mind operates, too. During conversations, my neurons just fire randomly, and it can take until the next conversation for me to figure out what my actual thoughts on the topic were, or what other relevant information was covered in cobwebs up in my noggin. I just sorta hold everything in my head at once, and wait for things to connect themselves so I can glean a meaning from them.

Writing is about the same. I rarely enter an essay or story knowing how it’s going to end, or how it will get there, or any other details of structure. Oftentimes, I’ll start writing in the middle of an essay (I wrote this whole section before I even began writing about Malcolm Gladwell). I spent a lot of time in English classes learning different methods of writing essays, but after internalizing them I inevitably stopped thinking about them. For better or worse, I’ve always just relied on my internal motor to drive my thoughts through each essay, and assume my editing skills will make sense of it all later.

I’ve written on this blog before about how I thought I should break this habit and work harder at writing outlines and writing with a purpose and direction in mind, but Hempel’s quote makes me wonder how helpful that would actually be. If the goal of writing is to take what’s in your head and put it onto paper as clearly as possible, I might be losing part of what’s in my head by trying to force it through an unnatural organizational process. Most of the neural connections I’ve made don’t reveal themselves in an orderly fashion, so maybe it’s ok if organization and structure remain exercises in revision. That’s exactly what they were for this essay—how’d I do?
