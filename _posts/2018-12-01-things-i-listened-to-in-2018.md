Here's a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/kylesparks/playlist/66B0Z6femelH9YrCxvESP1?si=Kl39k4-zR060kqPLPWkvqw) of all my most favorite songs from 2018, and what follows is a list of all my favorite albums from 2018. I might've forgotten some stuff, but I donno.

## actual favorite records
**Deafheaven** - [*Ordinary Corrupt Human Love*](https://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/album/ordinary-corrupt-human-love)<br />
i already went long on deafheaven over the summer, though at the time i expected this to be more popular on year-end lists. i guess i could be wrong, but that's not why i'm here.

**Mount Eerie** - [*Now Only*](https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/now-only) & [*(alive)*](https://pwelverumandsun.bandcamp.com/album/after-singing-and-guitar-at-jacobikerk-utrecht-netherlands-nov-10th-2017-at-le-guess-who-festival)<br />
maybe the best news i heard in 2018 was when phil elverum secretly married michelle williams. *now only* has more hooks than *a crow looked at me* so it's a bit easier to stomach, but this is still extremely heavy stuff and it's probably weird that i spent so much of 2018 wrapped up in it. i'm not gonna overthink it though.

**Soccer Mommy** - [*Clean*](https://sopharela.bandcamp.com/album/clean)<br />
i didn't expect this glow up but i'm extremely stoked for it. at the risk of sounding reductive, this is the record i wanted taylor swift to write after *red*. 

**Tierra Whack** - [*Whack World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOTebhPy04g)<br />
this had the catchiest songs i heard all year, and i love how it feels like an exercise in world building. she packs more ideas into these 15 minutes than maybe any other record on this list, but instead of feeling bloated or forced it's actually the lightest and most fun 15 minutes as well.
  
## tier 2: p dang good
**Cloud Nothings** - [*Last Building Burning*](https://cloudnothings.bandcamp.com/album/last-building-burning)<br />
glad they're back to playing loud and fast and angry stuff. if there's a better drummer in indie rock, i've yet to hear him.

**Hop Along** - [*Bark Your Head Off, Dog*](https://hopalong.bandcamp.com/album/bark-your-head-off-dog) <br />
if i'd made this list in april this would've been the runaway #1. i still think it's great, but i find myself revisiting *get disowned* more than any of their more recent records though.

**Jeff Rosenstock** - [*POST-*](https://jeffrosenstock.bandcamp.com/album/post)<br />
at the end of my bff corey's bachelor party—after corey, his brother, and i got schmacked on sazeracs and about four dozen oysters at felix's—in the cab to the airport, corey convinced the driver to hand over the aux cord, and for the last hour or so of the trip we blasted jeff rosenstock and yelled along to every word. a couple months later, when i was struggling to come up with an ending for the best man speech at his wedding, i just stole a rosenstock lyric. it was cheesy, but whatever. rosenstock is basically the poet laureate of millenials in late capitalism, and we're lucky to have him.

**Low** - [*Double Negative*](https://lowtheband.bandcamp.com/album/double-negative) <br />
i was very late to the game on this record, but i'll be listening to it for a lot of 2019 too. really crunchy ambient vibes that sound great whether it's raining or just dark outside.

**Snail Mail** - [*Lush*](https://snailmaillush.bandcamp.com/) <br />
one of the best guitarists / songwriters going. this is probably tier 1.5 for me, just cos the record has some filler.

**The Spirit of the Beehive** - [*Hypnic Jerks*](https://thespiritofthebeehive.bandcamp.com/album/hypnic-jerks) <br />
some of this band's songs are almost self-destructive—they'll write this incredible hook, and then right when you're falling into a groove they'll insert some weird distorted found sound tape and a drastic key change or a new time signature just to herky-jerk their way into a brand new hook that is also great.

**Trace Mountains** - [*A Partner to Lean On*](https://tracemountains.bandcamp.com/album/a-partner-to-lean-on) <br />
former lvl up guitarist/singer, really dig this solo project even if it's a lot quieter.
  
## tier 3: liked-didn't-love tier
**Big Ups** - [*Two Parts Together*](https://bigups.bandcamp.com/album/two-parts-together) <br />
r.i.p. to a real one. always loved seeing this band live, and this record's every bit as good as their others.

**boygenius** - [*boygenius*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5BRORKnC2HD5xhgUyR31SH?si=I5_Q7wNBSSKdyeePyAVARw) <br />
you've kinda gotta watch a live video (like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T5zc36sAIE)) to really get the moment toward the end of "me & my dog" when phoebe bridgers is talking about riding in a spaceship with her dog and she steps back from the mic and just lets it rip—*"I DREAM ABOUT IT"*—but that's one of my favorite song moments in a long time.

**Earl Sweatshirt** - [*Some Rap Songs*](https://open.spotify.com/album/66at85wgO2pu5CccvqUF6i?si=iQHBXY1VSG6kk6bj55zcqw) <br />
i've gotta spend some more time with this one, but his voice is so smooth it almost doesn't matter much to me what he's saying.

**gobbinjr** - [*ocala wick*](https://gobbinjr.bandcamp.com/album/ocala-wick) <br />
real fun bedroom pop type stuff, like what i kinda always want frankie cosmos records to sound like (still like frankie cosmos though)

**Hovvdy** - [*Cranberry*](https://hovvdy.bandcamp.com/album/cranberry) <br />
these songs are so simple i almost didn't get it at first, but eventually they kept getting stuck in my head enough that i realized i just plain like them.

**illuminati hotties** - [*Kiss Yr Frenemies*](https://illuminatihotties.bandcamp.com/album/kiss-yr-frenemies) <br />
another extremely fun pop rock record. this was the first i heard of them; i hope they keep doing this.

**Robyn** - [*Honey*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6WZjFvrzwq8SOGe0r8R3qk?si=EfDWzPVmTRG2_6el1tJc6A) <br />
everything robyn does is great.

**Tony Molina** - [*Kill the Lights*](https://tonymolina650.bandcamp.com/album/kill-the-lights) <br />
really love how committed he is to writing extremely concise guitar-pop songs, like a young big star in a hurry or something.

**Yowler** - [*Black Dog In My Path*](https://yowler.bandcamp.com/album/black-dog-in-my-path) <br />
really dig both yowler records, great for putting on during a rainy or cloudy day.

## tier 4: probly just as good as tier 3 but i didn't revisit as often

**American Pleasure Club** - [*a whole fucking lifetime of this*](https://americanpleasureclub.bandcamp.com/album/a-whole-fucking-lifetime-of-this)

**Courtney Barnett** - [*Tell Me How You Really Feel*](https://courtneybarnett.bandcamp.com/album/tell-me-how-you-really-feel)

**Janelle Monae** - [*Dirty Computer*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2PjlaxlMunGOUvcRzlTbtE?si=yLUg125kQpiDRVvrKqphPg)<br />
never listened to this record all that much, but i saw her live and she was _so good_.

**Adrianne Lenker** - [*abysskiss*](https://open.spotify.com/album/5W6TxvIqACEfnxm0VgPhv7?si=qJ6OxCtgSeSRM87nOtd71A)<br />
one of these days these songs are just going to click for me and i'm gonna regret not including it much higher.

## record that came out in 2017 that i discovered in 2018 and rules extremely hard:
**Booji Boys** - [*Weekend Rocker*](https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/album/weekend-rocker)
