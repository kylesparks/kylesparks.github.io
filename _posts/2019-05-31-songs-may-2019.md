*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of may in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

**purple mountains** is silver jews in all but name, and this single from david berman's new project has all the folksy guitar hooks and razor-sharp lyrics of his old band. i guess woods is working as his backing band now—another band i haven't heard from in a while, but holy smokes i'm into this song. very stoked to hear what else berman's got for us.

**strange ranger** has put out a bunch of cool emo-adjacent indie rock the past few years, but this is the most straightforward jam yet, channeling old teenage fanclub or built to spill guitar energy.

**charli xcx** has come a long ways since the goth-lite pop of ["nuclear seasons"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGmM2l39LEs) without ever really making a misstep. this track with lizzo is an absolute bop.

**truth club** released a full record of twitchy guitar rock, and it's been in constant rotation. honestly this whole record sounds great to me.

**tyler, the creator**'s new record is catchy and good, and i should spend more time with it. "earfquake" is a great bop for the summer.

### your mileage may vary
after LVL Up called it quits, guitarist mike caridi committed full time to running his record label (double double whammy) and putting out songs as **the glow**. "am i" is the glow's first record, and he decided to cover LVL Up's last song, [Orchard](https://lvlup.bandcamp.com/album/orchard). it's good! but it's not as good as the original. so it goes with the whole record—the vibe and the hooks are there, but it's just missing a little something. hope he finds it.

**katie dey**'s first two records, [*asdfasdf*](https://katiedey.bandcamp.com/album/asdfasdf) and [*flood network*](https://katiedey.bandcamp.com/album/flood-network-3) elicited immediate reactions from me. they were both so creative and bizarre and catchy that i couldn't quite put my finger on why, but i couldn't stop listening. *solipsisters* hasn't had such a pronounced effect, but stylistically these songs all hit the same sweet spot of warbled-pop that is unmistakeably of and for the internet.

**white reaper** have gone from trashy ty segall-indebted garage rock on their [self-titled debut](https://whitereaper.bandcamp.com/album/white-reaper) (they seem to have scrubbed everything from before then...) to more refined classic rock influences. it's a little slower and more polished, like sheer mag with more muted hooks, but at least on "might be right" i still dig it pretty good.

**running from the dark** is a compilation to benefit the national alliance on mental illness, and features a who's who of downer indie pop.

**spencer radcliffe and everyone else** records don't usually grab me immediately, but grow with me over time. [enjoy the great outdoors](https://spencerradcliffe.bandcamp.com/album/enjoy-the-great-outdoors) has developed into one of my favorite records of the last few years just by letting me revisit it regularly. gonna assume something similar happens with "hot spring."
