*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of april in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

i didn't know to expect a new **mannequin pussy** record this year, but now that i've heard "drunk ii" it's the only upcoming record i care about.

mannequin pussy have already put out two perfect records. [romantic](https://mannequinpussy.bandcamp.com/album/romantic) and [gypsy pervert](https://mannequinpussy.bandcamp.com/album/gp) are fast, insanely catchy blurs that bounce from hardcore to pop-punk. they pack riffs in rapid bursts—both LPs are over in about 20 minutes. but they never had the kind of buildup and layered harmonies we get at the end of "drunk ii." extremely looking forward to a whole record of this stuff.

### still required listening
the new **fka twigs** song and video are amazing

i love that **pile** writes those long, intricate, technically proficient songs, but i think my favorite version of pile is when rick just writes these total shit-rippers. "the soft hands of stephen miller" is the version of pile that 2019 needs most.

i'd been withholding judgment when the new **charly bliss** singles came out sounding like nu-paramore, but "hard to believe" is a great return to that sugary pop-rock that i crave. the video has a cool payoff at the end too.

### your mileage may vary
**rachel levy** (f.k.a. r.l. kelly) writes some real earworms, and i'm stoked about this new song, "better." it's worth digging back into her old stuff too—in addition to the awesome [life's a bummer](https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/album/lifes-a-bummer-2) cassette, she's also got split records with both [spencer radcliffe](https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/album/spencer-radcliffe-r-l-kelly-split-brown-horse) and [alex g](https://rlkelly.bandcamp.com/album/alex-g-r-l-kelly-split).

i don't know what qualifies as "slowcore" technically, but **horse jumper of love** writes slow songs that feel like they're patting your head, telling you everything's gonna be alright. their songs all end up sounding a bit similar to me, but i like this new one, "poison," pretty good.

<br />

**murg** is a black metal band from sweden, and their new record, strävan, threads the needle between abrasive and shoegaze in that way that i like.

**sunn o)))** also put out another banger. they have such a strong and consistent aesthetic, seems like if you like one of their records you'll love all of them. "life metal" included.

<br />

**inter arma** was another new discovery for me this month. it's slow-churning metal that sounds both guttural and transcendent at the same time.
