In his book Designing With The Mind In Mind, Jeff Johnson applied a scientific framework to the art of design. Johnson used empirical data to explain the rationale behind effective design elements, and provided a framework for design that I could benefit from more than the other books I’ve read. In the Foreword, Stuart Card describes how “Engineering does not replace art in a design, it makes it possible.” I’m nowhere near artistic enough that I could ever be considered an “artist,” but this suggests that if I can hammer down enough of the science and engineering behind it, maybe I can be confused for one.

That idea has been a running theme throughout my apprenticeship so far—by emphasizing the planning process and hammering down the nuts and bolts of the operation before we even start, we can make the final product and experience significantly smoother. 

8th Light designers make a habit out of this, spending a large chunk of time wire-framing and conceptualizing the organization and presentation of the website in InDesign or Balsamiq before spending any time on the site’s front-end code.

Prioritizing preparation in this way also addresses two main points that Johnson emphasized throughout the text: bridging the “gulf of execution,” and that reading is an unnatural process.

The “gulf of execution” simply refers to the disconnect between a user’s goals and the website’s presentation. If a user’s goal is to order a pizza, then the gulf of execution is as wide as the amount of work the user’s brain and eyes have to do in order to order a pizza. 

Wireframes afford designers the freedom to approach each page in a way that can address these gulfs in an immediate and low-stress environment. Johnson suggests employing an actions/objects analysis for this step. The analysis is simply a matrix that lists the actions of a site on one axis and the site's objects on another. If the action is to order a pizza, then there should be an obvious, task-oriented object through which the user can order a pizza. If not, there should be a disconnect that represents a gulf of execution.

One of the primary benefits of this analysis is that it helps reduce the amount of instructions on your page. Because asJohnson describes in chapter four, reading is an unnatural process. Even though I spend most of my time on the Internet seeking words to read, that’s not typical of most people, and it should not be typical of most websites. Normal humans open a web page and hope to encounter as little text as possible. They don't want words; they want actionable cues. They want smooth responses. They want seamless and intuitive navigation. They just want a pizza!

This speaks to another shortcoming of mine. While I spend so much time worrying about nerdy quirks of grammar, that’s only the engineering of prose. That stuff matters only insofar as it helps me achieve larger goals of composition. And while I'm still a novice at the engineering of design, I feel pretty comfortable with the engineering of the written word. So it stands to reason that I should pivot myself from focusing on grammatical tics to orienting myself more closely toward the psychology of prose. To accomplish this, I can:

- Produce more and better outlines.

- Use outlines to frame text with subheads that give readers the ability to skip over irrelevant words.

- Highlight task-oriented text.

- Incorporate graphical elements that could substitute 1,000 words.

- Use bullet points instead of commas for long, complicated lists.

The primary takeaway is that I should work much harder at making outlines. The backbone of a well-written essay is a well-written outline, but I didn’t even start thinking in terms of an outline for this blog post until I had already put 979 words into a draft and realized exactly how much of a mess it was. This blog post is still terribly overwritten, but even in this more finalized state I was able to reduce the word count to 905.

It’s still important for me to write through things at the early stages, because that’s how my brain makes sense of itself. But I can’t rely on some innate organizational ability to make sense of that writing later, because the truth is that that innate ability is a fallacy. Some people have it, but the perpetual whirlpool of paper in my bedroom that I call “my desk” speaks to just how badly I do not have it. I need to impose organization onto myself.

I’ve already begun some of this work. Before starting my apprenticeship, I invested in an organization-centric word processing program called Scrivener. It lets you do a lot of cool things like break different sections into different files that can be stored in the same file. You can easily upload non-text files as research, and view different documents side-by-side in the same window for easy reference. Scrivener also includes a notecard interface that lets you visualize the essay’s organization on an abstract level, then click through to see each section on a more granular level. 

In this way, Scrivener allows me to integrate the engineering aspects with the psychological aspects. It's just up to me to dedicate more time and energy to those psychological aspects that will make my writing bridge the gulf of execution, not extend it.
