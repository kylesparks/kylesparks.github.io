*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of june in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

**mannequin pussy** might've made my favorite album of the year. *patience* isn't quite the headrush of [romantic](https://mannequinpussy.bandcamp.com/album/romantic) or [gp](https://mannequinpussy.bandcamp.com/album/gp), but it's catchy and cathartic all the way through.

<br />

**palehound** also put out an instant classic. i was late coming around to [*a place i'll always go*](https://palehound.bandcamp.com/album/a-place-ill-always-go) despite it being something like a flawless, sad bedroom pop record (a.k.a. "my shit"), and *black friday* carries a lot of the same warm tones. *black friday* feels a little less intimate—and there's probably some good analysis about *a place i'll always go* being about coming to terms with yourself and *black friday* discovering your place in the external world—but i think the point is that these reactions are pretty personal, and the only responsible thing for me to do in this situation is lead the horse (you) to water.

<br />

**angel olsen** got a song on the mark ronson album, and it's 5:48 of woozy, folksy disco perfection.

### not required, suggested 

**alex g** announced a new album and released a single that suggests this one will be a perfect indie rock record, just like all the other ones.

<br />

**jay som** announced a new album, and the first advance single is exactly the kind of catchy and fun jangle-pop that made [*everybody works*](https://jaysom.bandcamp.com/album/everybody-works) one of my very favorite records of 2017.

<br />

**bill callahan** put out a new, awesome record that is highly recommended if you like the kind of thing bill callahan does.

<br />

**stef chura** takes from a lot of the familiar 90s indie rock touchstones you hear all over, but she somehow finds a distinct voice within it. there are some parts that don't really connect for me, but "all i do is lie" and "scream" are an awesome way to start the album, and i think i'll probably return to this a lot throughout the rest of the year.

<br />

**booji boys** play scrappy, noisy garage rock that's loud and fun. i was very into their [weekend rocker](https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/album/weekend-rocker) record from 2017, and this new record is more of the same.

<br />

**hovvdy** & **lomelda** are two different groups, though they both excel at quiet, guitar-based folksy pop songs. before going on tour together they record this ep in which they cover each other's songs. i think "out there" works pretty well, but i'm having a hard time separating these from their source and evaluating them on their own. or, perhaps they're just not as good. too soon to tell.

<br />

**freddie gibbs & madlib** teamed up for a classic rap album.

### your mileage may vary 

ian cohen put together a retrospective and accompanying playlist of **"chillwave at 10."** i'm not sure what role chillwave played in the larger culture, but it was the defining vibe of my college years so this kind of thing is like cat nip for me.

**horse jumper of love**'s new record keeps the same slow pace of their [self-titled debut](https://horsejumperoflove.bandcamp.com/album/horse-jumper-of-love), but there's a little more personality that comes out. it's going to take a little more time for me to have a more meaningful reaction to it, but it's a pleasant listen, and kinda reminding me of pure x.

<br />

**king gizzard & the lizard wizard** have probably surpassed thee oh sees and ty segall as the most prolific garage rockers going. they put out five (5) new albums in 2017, and they just announced their second of 2019—and it's a thrash metal record. sign me up.

<br />

**sheer mag** are a timeless classic rock band, and new single "blood from a stone" features more of their brand of exploding hearts-and-thin lizzy jingle jangle rock. some of their recorded music can kind of blend together for me, but please promise you won't miss a chance to see this band live.

<br />

**fuming mouth** were a new discovery for me this month. they play a style of fast and punishing hardcore similar to bands like nails and full of hell, and i've been listening to this new record of theirs quite a bit while working this month.
