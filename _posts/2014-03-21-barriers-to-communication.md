>Words are a barrier to communication.

That quote comes from Luke Sullivan’s Hey Whipple, Squeeze This, and is attributed to award-winning creative director John Hegarty. The quote stuck with me throughout the rest of the book, and spun a few different threads in my head. I’m going to break them out into two different posts to unpack two different aspects of communication in which words can act as barriers: thinking in this post, and execution in part 2.

***

I began working on my first real copywriting project last week, which means I’ve been brainstorming more or less non-stop since. But throughout the process, I’ve routinely caught myself thinking not about the product or image, but the words themselves. In an attempt to brainstorm more constructively, I was writing sentences that were catchy and resonant, but not necessarily true. Or, they’d be unnecessarily vague. Or, the image they conjured might have been vivid, but it would be slightly different from that which we wanted to project. There was a disconnect between concept and execution, and it happened because I was rushing to the latter before fully establishing the former.

It’s counterintuitive for me to think of brainstorming as being language-less, since every thought that runs through my head does so in a language of words. But it’s important to distinguish their functions. In the early stages of the brainstorming process, words should be acting only as messengers of thought, not the thought itself.

Later, I found another relevant quote to this distinction from Susan Credle, chief creative officer of Leo Burnett, in Teressa Iezzi’s The Idea Writers:

“One of the things I say over and over to the creatives I work with, especially people who have come up on TV spots, is to ask not just, is this ad funny, will it get viewed, but am I setting up an idea that will have a life of its own?”

This becomes especially important with a new product like the ones the 8th Light development team builds all the time. Every new product we build will also require us to build a new brand. And here “brand” becomes jargon for “life.” It needs relatable attributes and redeeming qualities. It must crawl before it walks; it must mumble before it speaks; it must think before it writes.

At this point it’s especially helpful to focus on my role as not just a writer, but a design apprentice whose focus is writing.

They say you know you’re fluent in a language when you start to dream in it, and I can say that the rare dreams I recall are all conversations and emotions. Very rarely do I recall any images. Another thing they say is that nobody else cares about your dreams, but I’m using them here only to illustrate the point that while words come naturally (fluently) to me, images do not. To really excel in this position, I should be able to use both interchangeably, symbiotically.

That’s going to require some growth in the ways I think so that words aren’t overcompensating. Words function entirely on the execution side of the language equation, and when they encroach on the concept they can obfuscate the image and style. Communication between humans is multi-dimensional, and it’s essential that we don’t let words do too much and act as barriers to these other dimensions.
