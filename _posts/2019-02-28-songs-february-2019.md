*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of february in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

**pup** is one of the best pop-punk bands going, and one of the only bands that consistently comes up with original and entertaining concepts for music videos. case in point: both ["kids"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqTNdUOE1wo) and ["free at last"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhhyrmF0C_s), the first two singles from **morbid stuff**. i'm very stoked to hear the rest.

<br />

**tierra whack** was responsible for one of my very favorite albums of 2018, and i can't imagine a time in 2019 when "only child" won't be stuck in my head.

<br />

**girlpool**'s previous albums are pretty unimpeachable, so i don't mean anything too harsh when i say their new record is maybe my least favorite. counterpoint: this song, "hire," is up there with ["it gets more blue"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PRIyi8OIgI) and ["cut your bangs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfO_xb9124U) and ["i like that you can see it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvGlEY75BRY) as one of the best songs there's ever been, imho.

### suggested, not required
adrienne leneker's solo record is really soft and subtle and still sneaking its way into heavy rotation for me, but this new **big thief** wasted no time in just wrapping me up like a burrito.

the week before i saw grouper at the athletic association she dropped this under the name **nivhek**. liz harris writes songs that worm inside my brain in a way nobody else's songs do.

<br />

**drugdealer** is the newest moniker, f.k.a. salvia plath and also f.f.k.a. run dmt (sensing a theme?). this is some smooth jazz, steely dan-revivalist stuff. also worth watching the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHY-rgmjEq4), in which every outfit is :chefs-kiss:

<br />

**julia jacklin**'s new record covers a lot of ground. thematically this record chronicles the fallout of a relationship-gone-bad, so you get a lot of downers like "don't know how to keep loving you," "when the family flies in," "convention", "good guy," etc.; but you also get the outbursts of songs like "head alone," "you were right," and the song i keep going back to most often, "pressure to party." it's about social anxiety or somethin'.

<br />

to borrow a cliche, **jessica pratt** could sing the phone book and i'd soak it up.

## your mileage may vary
**club night** sounds like gorilla vs bear circa 2012, when trevor powers (nee youth lagoon) and gauntlet hair were the wavve. jingle-jangle guitars with warbled vocals. it's not chillwave, but it's nice.

<br />

**empath** first came to my attention last year with a blown-out, noisy pop record that reminded me of a lot of the late-2000s noisy twee / indie pop bands (los campesinos! chief among them, but also the go! team, [dananananaykroyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozwJYL7wN5Q), that kinda thing). [the eye](https://empathx.bandcamp.com/track/the-eye) remains a bop. this new song is a bit more streamlined into a hook; i dig it.

**stella donnelly** put out an ep last year i liked quite a bit ([spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/3cNfpFYkoy94IA1zpNqiMD?si=Q4LJvzh4ReSPIQpvXrr4sg)), and i like this new record too. i dig her vibe a lot—kinda like julia jacklin above, but also kinda like sidney gish. biting commentary on the patriarchy—but fun!

<br />

**show me the body** remain one of my favorite hardcore bands going. all available evidence suggests their forthcoming lp will be vital.

<br />

just last year **deafheaven** put out ordinary corrupt human love, which was essential listening, but also atmospheric and even soft at times. deafheaven are never going to win over black metal purists, and i liked the new sounds quite a bit. but "black brick" is a drastic course correction. this is pummeling stuff. i love it.

<br />

**dead heat** was a new band to me this month. it looks like they've been putting out records for a few years, but not nearly as many years as their sound suggests. this is old school, 80s, hardcore-meets-speed-metal urgent-rock. really scratching an itch for me in 2019.

**yohuna** put out a record on orchid tapes in 2016 that had a lot of good songs, and one that's stuck in my head ever since (["the moon hangs in the sky like nothing hangs in the sky"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4egtnfuAKA)). "mirroring" might be more on the good side of the spectrum, but it hits a similar sweet spot for me.
