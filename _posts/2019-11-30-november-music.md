*required listening and more—music i listened to and liked from the month of november in the year of our lord 2019. you can follow along with my spotify playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJYx99uthizmX34ptPomI?si=BSVMRH9cSReell117Zq7lg).*

i'd never heard of **dogleg**, but i can't quit listening to their new song, fox. it's got rowdy and fast skate punk vibes and doesn't really have a hook necessarily, it's just a three minute burst of fun times.

### metal

i spent most of this month lost in a handful of metal releases. 

my personal favorite metal band, **kvelertak**, released their first single since replacing their lead singer. “båtebrann” is a little smoother than the [older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ZG0QpYAWQ) [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g36fWfErL9w), maybe a little more traditional "hair metal" hooks and solos—i'm thinking of def leppard here—but it still whips pretty hard.

**blood incantation** was a new discovery i learned about via stereogum. they play death metal, though there's something about the instruments (the way they're recorded? the way they're played? a little of both?) that scans to me like they'd almost be a prog band if they weren't so brutal. i'm extremely into it.

<br />

**frail body** were another new find. they play something closer to screamo, and are a perfect pairing with one of my favorite discoveries of last year, [portrayal of guilt](https://portrayalofguilt.com/album/let-pain-be-your-guide). really heavy music, with, you know, emotions or whatever.

<br />

**alcest**'s new album actually came out in october, but it didn't grab me till this month. they're some french guys who play what they call post-metal, though *spiritual instinct* covers a lot of ground. i'm going to project some of my own taste and bias here: this record often feels like it's striving for the euphoric parts of a deafheaven or godspeed epic, and sometimes i think it succeeds. it was a great change of pace from the depths i sometimes found myself in after listening to blood incantation and frail body on repeat.

<br />

**red death** hits the sweet spot between hardcore and speed metal that i like, and *sickness divine* is great. it didn't come out till later in the month, but it's already growing on me.

### yr mileage may vary

**laura stevenson** and **adult mom** are each awesome on their own, and before going on tour together they teamed up for a cool split where they covered one of the other's songs. in my opinion, it's great!

**osees** is just another way to spell john dwyer's musical pursuit, and he put out this synthy, trippy 12" that i've had on repeat during a few afternoons working. i'm sure it rewards closer listening, but so far i've just been very into the vibes.

i don't know what to do with this **greet death** album, *new hell*, exactly. its nine songs are all over the place, each taking a slightly different spin on some kind of slowcore. it's dense, and despite listening maybe a dozen times, i still haven't really cracked it yet. there are hooks, and guitar solos, and catchy vocals; and they all ride the same waves of guitar. if that sounds like your kind of thing, it probably is.

**loma prieta** have been around for a long time, but i'm just getting acquainted. most of what i've seen written about them nowadays mentions how their new stuff was produced by the same guy behind deafheaven, but to my ears they sound more like some triangulation of no age, metz, and touche amore. they've been around as long or longer than each of them though, so if i was more educated those comparisons would likely go in reverse. anyway, it's a long way of saying they make noisy rock n roll that's extremely up my alley.
