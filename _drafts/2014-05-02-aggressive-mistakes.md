title: Aggressive Mistakes

I play shortstop in a 16-inch softball league every Wednesday night, and I have an annoying habit of talking constantly. Usually I’m just spouting nonsense about mashin’ taters and the Power of Positive Intensity, but I also frequently repeat a phrase an old high school football coach once told me: never apologize for an aggressive mistake. 

Nearly eight years later, that message continues to resonate with me, but Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson would probably call it defeatist. In their book REWORK, the duo wrote an entire section called “Learning from mistakes is overrated” (pg. 16). Their reasoning is pretty basic: why make mistakes? They cite a New York Times article about a Harvard Business School study that found that “already-successful entrepreneurs are far more likely to succeed again … But entrepreneurs whose companies failed the first time had almost the same follow-on success rate as people starting a company for the first time.”

I can’t really debate empirical evidence, but I have a fundamental disagreement with the conclusions drawn by Fried and Heinemeier Hansson here, not to mention their message. If someone is good at something, they’re like to continue to be good at it in the future—I agree there, but I don’t see that as cause for broad pessimism. Allow me to indulge myself in a sports anecdote.

Even the most casual MLB fans knew to expect Albert Pujols toward the top of the home run leaderboard in 2010.  He’d been a revelation ever since entering the league as a 21-year-old standout in 2001, and was coming off back-to-back MVP awards. His National League-leading 42 dingers in 2010 were merely average for a guy who’d mashed 47 the year prior. He had been successful, and would continue to be successful. 

But Pujols finished second in the MLB home run race behind a very unlikely candidate: 29-year-old Jose Bautista. In his six years of service time before 2010, Bautista had never once hit more than 16 longballs in a single season. And with his career OPS hovering in the .650-.750 range, there wasn’t much peripheral data to suggest a surge in power was forthcoming. 

Many people assumed Bautista had begun taking steroids to boost his power, but the reality was much simpler. During the offseason, Bautista had altered his batting stance to close his hips a little more. This put more load on his back leg, and more snap in his hips. He was simply swinging harder, with more muscles in his lower half contributing. 

It’s hard to call someone who’d spent six years in the major leagues a failure, but in those six years he’d played for five different teams. He hadn’t known great success before, but he took what was available to him and applied it differently—more aggressively—and reaped the rewards.

It’s easy to cherry-pick anecdotes of unlikely successes exactly like this one, but I guess that’s my point. Wasn’t America the country founded by underdogs, for underdogs? And yet these two successful tech geeks are proselytizing elitist garbage about the rich getting richer.

I digress, and will proceed with a more measured tone. 

Because we can look at this at a very basic level: if there’s no observable change between those who’ve failed and those who’ve never tried, then what’s the cost of failure? There are material costs of a failed business, but there are existential costs of unrealized potential as well. If I were writing a book with the intention of advising aspiring entrepreneurs, I’d see a gulf between these two dilemmas that could be successfully navigated with equal parts pragmatism and diligence.

Whether the authors want to admit it or not, mistakes happen. And they aren’t always disastrous (Fried and Heinemeier Hansson made grammatical mistakes in their book, yet they’ve managed to sell a few copies). Whether they’re physical errors on a softball diamond or marketing missteps in a start-up’s first year, they’re unavoidable.

But if your head and heart are in the right place, they’re less likely to sink you, and you’re more likely to learn from them. You’re more likely to execute the right play, or target the right audience the next time you’re in that same situation. The universe is a wild and random place that will do all sorts of confusing and frustrating things to you; but so long as you continue to put yourself in positions to succeed, everything usually evens out.

So maybe the message should have been more about learning to find these positions for success. What preparatory work can you do to mitigate risks and maximize your potential? I’m no help with entrepreneurial endeavors, but I can promise that if you avoid mental errors on the softball diamond, the physical errors will eventually dissolve as well.

Ultimately, I would’ve liked to have seen more data on the background of the entrepreneurs in this study’s sample. What are the common denominators? Which schools did they attend? What was the market like before they entered? Where did they allocate their budgets differently from their less-successful competitors? Heck, who are their parents? 

There's a profound degree of nuance that we're ignorant of, because Fried and Heinemeier Hansson just made a broad-scope assertion based on a newspaper write-up. That’s not an aggressive mistake; it’s a failure to engage in critical thinking. That's the kind of thing that could sink an entrepreneur.
