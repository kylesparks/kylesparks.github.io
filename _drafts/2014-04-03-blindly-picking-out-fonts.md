title: Blindly Picking Out Fonts

I finished reading Ellen Luptonâ€™s Thinking With Type as part of my apprenticeship about one day before reading that a 14-year-old was proposing to save the U.S. government millions of dollars by changing their font from Times New Roman to the thinner Garamond (via this story on [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/27/living/student-money-saving-typeface-garamond-schools/index.html?hpt=hp_t2)).

Suvir Mirchandani is a sixth-grade <del>overachiever</del> student in the Pittsburgh area who spent his science fair project looking for ways to use computer science to promote environmental sustainability in his school. And as it turns out, Mirchandani says, "Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume."

So he weighed some fonts with APFill Ink Coverage Software, and also by printing them onto cardstock, cutting out the letters, and weighing them on a scale. That process sounds really adorable, but it was also effective. He estimates that by switching to the lighter Garamond font, his school could save as much as $21,000 each year on ink. Using the same math, the federal government could cut about $136 million per year. 

It's a cool story for sure, but the practical applications for my apprenticeship are pretty limited. There's very little ink involved in web design, so typography is rarely a matter of fiscal importance. Besides, the entire decision seems to hinge on the idea that the difference in usability between Times New Roman and Garamond is negligible. 

And I think that speaks to my biggest takeaway from reading Thinking With Type: all these fonts just sort of look the same to me. I can tell what reads well and what doesn't, but among the fonts that read well, I have no idea how to even begin deciding which is better.

I want to pull back a bit before I give the impression that I thought the book was a waste of time. I learned important things about spacing and the origins of font families and things like that. I can distinguish between serifs and non-serifs, I can pick a font with a tall x-height that will be easier to read on smaller screens, and I can pick a font with sizable counters so that the letters don't just become clumps. But that's all just abstract theoretical concepts that do very little when it comes to actually choosing a font that fits a design. All I'm really doing is going down a checklist, ruling out a number of fonts for traits that make them less usable, when it feels like I should have more of a sense for style. I know how to put on a T-shirt and a pair of pants, but did I really pick out the right ones?

So I'm prepared to entertain the possibility that this is symptomatic of a character flaw (this joke would be more obvious if you could see what I'm wearing right now), but there are enough blogs out there dedicated to teaching me how to pick out clothes that I'm going to hold out hope there's a follow-up book that can teach me how to pick out fonts.
