What I'm reading
- We've got people 5/5
the book reads very casual, like he's sitting down for a drink and sharing stories from the road over the past few decades, but it serves as something like a starter pack for anyone who wants to understand the struggle between progressives and establishment democrats—both its current incarnation and the history that's built up to it.

- health justice now 4/5
tim faust has a strong voice that might sound kinda overly righteous to some, but i found it refreshing for these subjects to be presented in a way that wasn't immediately defensive. a lot of the talking points around medicare for all will be familiar to leftists who spend a lot of time online, but i appreciated how exhaustive he was at naming the different pressures at play—not just insurance and pharma companies, but also our housing, our environment, our social services, our labor...—as well as the vision he provides of single-payer not as a policy solution, but as a tool that unlocks a more holistic ecosystem of wellness. plus he's a packers fan.

- socialist manifesto 4/5
hard to say how compelling of a case this book would've been if i wasn't already predisposed to its arguments. it offers a pretty good crash course in socialist history, but its efforts to cover such a broad history while also appealing to a broad audience means there's a lot of meat left on the bones of these stories. though i suppose in some sense the most success this book could hope for would be to inspire readers to go out and learn more.

- mistaken identity 5/5
i'll need to re-read this several times before i've fully digested everything, but within a very short read asad haider traced the roots of identity politics in the black freedom struggle, showed how different iterations of it have failed, and offers ideas to avoid those same trappings and build multi-racial solidarity. 

- red state revolt 4/5
an extremely readable tale of teacher strikes in locations that aren't traditionally known for progressive politics. it offers insights into some techniques that made these strikes successful, and genuine hope that the working class across red and blue states can finally stand up for itself and organize.

- a crisis wasted 4/5
i wouldn't call this a "fun" read. hundt is heavy with details, both in data and extensive quoting. this book includes some graphs that baffled me. these things help build credibility, but i sometimes struggled to keep up with the larger plot. still, the core arguments and themes were apparent, and i can't imagine finishing this book without holding contempt for obama and his team's response to the financial crisis. two primary themes that resonated throughout: obama rushed to solve a problem that wasn't yet mature and that he didn't fully understand, and the methods he used were favorable to the banks and exceptionally inadequate to everyone else.

- debs graphic novel 4/5
eugene debs' story feels as important in 2019 as it ever has been. i enjoyed the graphic novel approach, and on the whole this is a net positive on my bookshelf, but the storytelling itself felt a bit unorganized.

- republic of lies 4/5
merlin does a great job of connecting insane right-wing conspiracies to actual historical precedent that makes them seem a lot less loony. the line between conspiracy nut and diligent skeptic is a lot thinner than ya think. 


- the fifth risk 4/5
you can find 2/3rds of this published in magazines, and i highly recommend finding some way to get through it. i thought lewis did a great job painting a humane but haunting view of just how bad trump has really ruined everything.

- the fall of wisconsin 4/5
- janesville 4/5

- haunting of hill house 5/5
this book absolutely ruled, and legit scared me.

- CHAOS 4/5
this book is extremely long, and i'll admit that it got a little slow and tedious toward the middle as i tried keeping track of all the different characters and plot points and the red string that ties them all together. this might be a dealbreaker for some, as it never builds up to a single smoking gun or otherwise tidy ending. but if you're willing to accept conspiracy theories for what they are, you might find yourself like me: captivated till the end, wishing only there was more.
