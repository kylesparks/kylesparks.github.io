## podcasts

since podcasts took up as much attention as albums in my 2019 listening, here's a quick list of the podcasts i liked the most:

**intercepted** is jeremy scahill's weekly reported work. he has a lot of great guests and covers a wide range of issues domestic and international. makes a dumb guy like me feel smart.

**trillbilly worker's party** is a group of three folx in appalachia who get together and shoot the shit from eastern kentucky. i think they're hilarious and one of my can't-miss pods, but sometimes they're also pretty bleak. your mileage may vary.

**trueanon** is about jeffrey epstein and the broader project of taking down the pedos who carry outsized influence in the world. that kinda topic is extremely "my shit," and brace belden is maybe the funniest guy there is.

**the bruenigs** is the matt-and-liz duo explaining current events and whatnot. personally, i think they're great.

**radio war nerd** is gary brecher and mark ames' show about wars. the episodes get pretty long as they often get pretty in the weeds about things i know nothing about, but it's always informative and good. when you support their patreon they also send out newsletters that are often great.

**the vast majority** is micah uetricht (jacobin managing editor) who often brings on guests to explain new books or introduce new candidates running on socialist platforms.

**foreign exchanges** is derek davison's podcast on, well, foreign affairs. there are free episodes, but you can also subscribe to his substack for more episodes and also a regular email that provides pretty dense recap in the day in the world.

and here's sort of the second-tier podcasts i listen to regularly:
- chapo trap house will always hold a special place as the podcast that introduced me to a lot of my favorite writers/thinkers/podcasters, though it's grown less essential over the year or so.
- citations needed is a media criticism podcast that i think does a real good job of introducing issues in the way folks talk about and frame things that sometimes opens my eyes to some underlying issues i hadn't considered.
- district sentinel radio has been a handy alternative to something like an NPR news brief when i just want to catch up on the day in DC in 15 minutes or so.
- rumble is michael moore's new podcast that i've been bingeing while on vacation. he's a good, deferential interviewer, which means some episodes (robert de niro) are less interesting than others, but i thought his interview with alex press was awesome so i'm going to keep coming back.
