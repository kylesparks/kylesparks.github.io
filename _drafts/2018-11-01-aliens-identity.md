*The following was repurposed from a presentation given at an internal company mini-conf in October 2018. If I used your photographs without permission I'm sorry.*

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.002.jpeg" />

I'm going to start this talk at the beginning. Go way back in history. Talk about the original aliens. I’m speaking of course about ancient aliens.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.003.jpeg" />

It’s a popular show on the History channel. The basic premise I guess is that a bunch of weird things happened throughout ancient history, and guys like this guy...

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.004.jpeg" />

...will tell ya the only plausible answer is they got help from aliens.

Example: How is it that civilizations across the world built structures that used the same blueprint?

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.005.jpeg" />

Aliens.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.006.jpeg" />

How could you do stonehenge without trucks?

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.007.jpeg" />

Aliens.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.008.jpeg" />

Sphynx?

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.009.jpeg" />

Aliens.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.010.jpeg" />

How about these hieroglyphs of aliens? This guy is sitting down on what could only possibly be a dang spaceship. This is undeniable proof of...

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.011.jpeg" />

Aliens!

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.012.jpeg" />

Mayans were one of the most technologically advanced civilizations in recorded history, and they all just disappeared?

Either they were always aliens or they became aliens when they disappeared from our planet for good.

It’s an appealing narrative. But it also, uh, doesn’t make a ton of sense. If aliens came down and built this...

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.013.jpeg" />

...where the heck were they when we tried building this?

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.014.jpeg" />

Or even just like, I donno, Milwaukee Avenue, or I-94? 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.015.jpeg" />

(That's some Chicago-specific humor and that joke isn’t going to work as well for those of you visiting from another office.)

The reality is that all of these ancient coincidences aren’t really coincidences, nor are they “impossible,” they’re just reliant on really intelligent people working really hard and in coordination with each other.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.016.jpeg" />

The reason the architectures look the same is because the materials look the same—unless your argument is that these same blueprints are implanted in babies at birth by aliens.

And you actually can move massive blocks if you run enough water underneath, and use ropes and pulleys and whatever other engineering words—those all existed.

[<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.017.jpeg" />](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5pZ7uR6v8c&feature=youtu.be&a=)

And the reality is that Mayans didn’t disappear. Maybe there was an epidemic, or some other natural disaster, or maybe the people just grew tired of their rulers and spread out in the jungle, and it’s a lot harder to find their small villages than it was to find the massive city centers. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.018.jpeg" />

But the more compelling evidence is that there are approximately 4 million people today who speak a Mayan language as their first language—these people didn’t disappear, they’re still here today.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.019.jpeg" />

I learned just about all this stuff from this guy David S Anderson, who’s pretty good at responding to these claims on Twitter, and he quickly helped me understand that all these Ancient Aliens concepts are pretty messed up, because they’re all built on this presumption that these older, non-western civilizations couldn’t possibly have done anything good by themselves. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.020.jpeg" />

And anyway, like I was saying, if aliens were so prevalent in ancient times, where the heck have they been since? 

Here’s something interesting I put together—custom research, just for this talk—it’s a graph charting UFO sightings by date. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.021.jpeg" />

You see a few old ones. These are cool. But they’re also likely to be the result of natural phenomenon that is familiar to us now, or in some cases it’s actually commonly believed to be “yellow journalism” where the reporter’s just, like, havin' a laugh. But what we see is that in the early to mid 20th century we see an abrupt uptick in reports, steadily increasing till present day.

Here’s another graph I made. Same x axis—covering the same amount of time—but this time I want to look at not Unidentified Flying Objects, but *Identified* Flying Objects. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.022.jpeg" />

Humans have been using flying objects for, like, combat purposes for a long time. Ancient Chinese forces used manned balloons as spies. Abe Lincoln actually even commanded the Union Army Balloon Corps in the Civil war, they’d go check out the terrain and see if they could spy on Rebel forces, but the thing is these were not like super effective. The balloons were hard to make, and you could only go so high, and you had to be tethered to a string—it sorta stunk, and they de-funded the balloon program shortly after the Civil War.

In 1903 the Wright Brothers got themselves up in the air in a not-balloon, and only seven years later the Navy did their first test of going up in an airplane and shooting a gun. Steady innovation followed. During and after WWII was the big innovation period though. WWII is when planes really started doing aerial combat, and eventually leading toward a quick acceleration in airplane technology. 

So ok, I’ve shown you two graphs now: (1) reports of UFOs over time and (2) planned flights over the same period of time. Obviously I did this for a reason. What reason could that be? Well we’re gonna smush 'em together:

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.023.jpeg" />

It’s a direct correlation. The more we fly, the more we see others flying. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.024.jpeg" />

Coincidentally or not, these spikes in air travel and in reported UFO sightings also coincided with the period described in books like Revolutionary Road, White Noise, and Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. These books describe an America that was growing increasingly anxious, distrusting, and responding by receding into itself. We no longer participated in local groups, or engaged with politics in the same way. We began locking our doors and viewing others as, well, others. Strangers. Aliens, maybe.

Now am I saying that the rise in UFO sightings is nothing more than a reflection of our growing anxiety and trust issues in not only new technology but also in our communities, our government, extended out to other countries with different cultures? Do I think aliens are a convenient manifestation of our new national fear and loneliness?

I mean of course not, there’s no way I did enough research last night to say anything like that in any intellectually rigorous way, but I’m still using it as a narrative device to get me to the next point, the cultural touchstone that serves as the crux of this whole talk: we’re making contact, we’re talking about X-Files.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.025.jpeg" />

X-Files is one of the most popular shows ever on television, but if you’ve missed out, what you really need to know is that it’s fueled by the dynamic (dialectic, maybe) between Agent Fox William Mulder and his partner, Agent Dana Katherine Scully. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.026.jpeg" />

Let's start with Fox. Fox Mulder is a brilliant iconoclast in the FBI, stuck working in the basement on the aforementioned “X-Files.” Mulder has an encyclopedic knowledge of these case files of the absurd. Anything remotely supernatural—whether it’s a cult, or an infamous “monster of the week,” or an explicit sighting or interaction with an extraterrestrial, Mulder knows all the ins, the outs, the major players. He has a tireless work ethic, which we discover is fueled by his quest to learn what happened to his sister, whom he believes was abducted by aliens when they were children. He’s the prototypical television lead who’s too smart to be fired, but too much of a loose cannon to be trusted with any so-called “serious business.” So he has his pet projects (sometimes literally, right) and the Feds stick him in the basement until they can figure out how to "fix" him.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.027.jpeg" />

Enter: Dana Scully, a relatively new agent. She’s a medical doctor who graduated from FBI school with exemplary marks. A model recruit, eager to cut her teeth in the FBI’s noble pursuit of justice. Instead, she’s assigned to partner with Mulder, ostensibly because the bosses hope her level-headed, scientific approach to investigations will keep Mulder on task and in check. 

And for the first several seasons that’s exactly what she did. She was the “skeptic” who forced Mulder back down to Earth both figuratively and literally, right? She kinda serves the role of David S Anderson to Mulder’s Giorgio A Tsoukalos (the Ancient Aliens guy). That’s sort of the narrative that Chris Carter and FOX wanted us to buy into.

But I think that over time, revisiting that series in 2018, there’s another interpretation that’s a bit more generous to our hero Scully. 

Mulder—and by extension, the entire series—is drawn to the spectacle. If there’s a flashing light in the sky, or a suspicious goo residue, or a bunch of broken mirrors and a crow that shows up in all these crime scenes, it’s a straight line to the supernatural and extraterrestrial. He just can’t imagine anything happening by chance, or another human being doing something so wild.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.028.jpeg" />

But in a lot of cases Scully finds a simpler explanation. There’s some powerful figure with a lot to lose. There’s an insecure psychopath doing unthinkable things to keep their family together. There’s a secret society or community group with secrets they’re invested in keeping hidden.

In all of these instances, the show wants us to think Scully is failing in some way; she has some imaginative shortcoming that prevents her from accepting the fantastic. But I think sometimes it’s Mulder who reveals his ignorance by jumping to supernatural causes. Scully wasn’t just skeptical of the supernatural, she was also driven by her personal experience as a woman navigating the FBI, which perhaps has given her a greater appreciation of the capacity for evil within powerful human beings.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.029.jpeg" />

That section ended on kind of a bummer, but this is something everyone will like.

This is the part where I say all these cultural threads come together in a world that’s continued retreating into itself, and now it’s produced a generation of youths that were raised by the television (including X-Files), and for whom the strangest, most alien creature imaginable is the one that looks back at them in the mirror.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.030.jpeg" />

Starring in this phase is of course Blink 182. The pop-punk group became famous for their songs about teenage angst and mischief filtered through accessible hooks and potty humor, but I’d argue they became famous-famous in a way that, say, NOFX, or MxPx, or Sum 41 didn’t, famous in a way that allows them to still sell out a week-long residency at the Palms in Vegas in 2018—we’re talking Britney Spears famous—it’s because they provided incisive, relatable anthems about the messier parts of adolescence. They spoke with empathy and directly to not just class clowns, but also to kids who might be struggling with self esteem, or caught in the middle of their parents’ divorce, or just constantly confused and anxious and alone. What I’m trying to say is that they were, uh, emo, but, uh, cool.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.031.jpeg" />

Now there are several different songs I could use to elaborate on this point, but the one that’s most convenient for my narrative is called "Aliens Exist," off the 1999 album *Enema of the State*. In it, Delonge describes the sensation of being abducted by aliens: 

*Hey mom, there’s something in the backroom <br />
Hope it’s not the creatures from above <br />
You used to read me stories <br />
As if my dreams were boring <br />
We all know conspiracies are dumb*

But he suggests he’s in on the gag in the next verse, singing:

*I know the CIA would say <br />
What you hear is all hearsay*

The chorus ends with repeating “I’m not like you guys,” which I think speaks to this generational discomfort, this feeling of otherness being directed inward. On its face, it makes me think of Calvin dozing off in class to become Spaceman Spiff and fight aliens on another planet. It’s an entire universe and it’s bizarre and it’s thrilling and it’s all in your brain. Nobody else can possibly understand. And I think it’s possible that—at least at that point in Delonge’s life—that’s where he intended the song’s meaning to stop.

But the final chorus hints at something deeper.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.032.jpeg" />

Rather than repeating the line a final time, Delonge ends the song singing “Twelve majestic lies,” which is a reference to The Majestic 12, which was supposedly a committee set up to investigate or cover up the Roswell UFO mysteries. In December 1984, “top secret” documents were “accidentally” sent to a Hollywood television producer’s home, followed by a few more alleged leaks by other individuals. After the documents leaked, the FBI said the committee was bogus and the docs were fake… But isn’t that like exactly what they’d say if the documents were real?

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.033.jpeg" />

Tom Delonge quit Blink 182 in 2015. He claims to have had contact with aliens multiple times, and he’s devoting himself full-time to exploring “Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon.” He started reaching out to people in politics, trying to chase down the real Majestic 12. The cigarette smoking man, if you will.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.034.jpeg" />

We learned about this in March 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s email server was hacked and leaked. Included on that server was a bunch of emails from Delonge to Hillary’s campaign manager, John Podesta. If Podesta replied, he took it to a different email server (or however it works, I donno).

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.035.jpeg" />

But the real bombshell came last December, when the [New York Times published an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html) detailing a long-running, taxpayer-funded, covert program in the Pentagon that investigates UFOs but hasn’t released their findings. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.036.jpeg" />

That’s when people started digging deeper into what Delonge's been up to. He’s written some alien fiction, he runs the [Strange Times](http://strangetimes.tothestars.media/) website, and he founded the To The Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences that combined 10 scientists, aerospace engineers, and creatives. And it seems like he’s been in regular contact with the people behind the pentagon program, including former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.037.jpeg" />

There were reports last month that Delonge’s organization is $37M in debt. Blink 182 have continued on without him, and are currently in the middle of a run of shows in Las Vegas, which probly could’ve netted him a decent chunk of that, but certainly not all of it. $37M is not Blink 182 money, that’s U.S. government money. And if you believe Harry Reid, Delonge might actually be on the right track to get it. But let’s not kid ourselves: Harry Reid is a good enough guy, but can we trust him on this?

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.038.jpeg" />

This is the part of this talk when I remind everyone that at some point Scully’s views on aliens evolved. While she was able to solve many of the cases by exposing evil or just messed up humans, she was also presented with several seasons full of pretty undeniable evidence of supernatural interference, and eventually she crossed a threshold—but she didn’t cross over into pure belief. It’s not a binary. She doesn’t deny her past experiences, but incorporates them. 

Scully still believes in the capacity of powerful humans to act corruptly, and now that stuff just includes a massive conspiracy acting in concert with extraterrestrial species to satisfy their own selfishness and insatiable greed for power.

Delonge might never get Federal funding, he might die poor and alone and humiliated—and if we've learned any lessons from X-Files, that should make us all way more scared.

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.039.jpeg" />

This an interstellar object that passed by Earth and might have peeked in on us just this year. It’s shaped like a cigar. It took a curious trajectory and carried “excess acceleration” through and ultimately out of our solar system. It might have been a weird shaped rock, it might have been God's victory cigar, or it might have been a probe by an interstellar civilization and more of these objects might follow.

There are a lot of good scientific reasons for why aliens would show up any minute now, or have already showed up and are living among us. Counterpoint: there are also a lot of good scientific reasons why aliens are unlikely to show up during our lives.

Listen I’m not a scientist, that’s more y’all’s thing. Instead, the point of this talk, if in fact there actually was one, is I think there’s something interesting at a more sociocultural level when we start thinking about aliens more simply for what they are: canvases on which we've projected our own fears and dreams.

When we say aliens helped build some ancient structure, what we’re really saying is we don’t know how we would have, and thus can’t imagine how those civilizations could have. We're quick to blame aliens for things we don't want to believe, and we're quick to ostracize people for pursuing these explanations further. We even fashion aliens in our own image: they've got heads and eyes and mouths and arms and legs and they're exactly like us just stranger. 

<img class="postimage" src="/images/aliens/aliens preso.040.jpeg" />

And so my hope with this talk was not to convince any skeptics that (to borrow a line) the truth is out there, because that’s impossible. Instead, my hope was to suggest to skeptics and believers alike, that we should stop and think about what we’re talking about when we’re talking about aliens. And if you’re feeling skeptical or cynical or just down, thinking about how all the evils of the world are our fault, maybe remind yourself that the strongest, nicest, most innovative people—the ones who build pyramids and monuments and baseball stadiums and ice cream cakes—they’re already here too.
