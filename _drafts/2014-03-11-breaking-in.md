This is my first week as the first copywriter apprentice in 8th Light’s history, a fact that has added a few layers to the normal first-week, how-will-I-ever-learn-everyone’s-name jitters.

Without a real precedent for this writing position, my apprenticeship is under the direction of Stephanie Briones. Stephanie’s been a UX craftsman for several years, and will help me integrate into the design team where I’ll be writing copy inside websites and applications. This is a positive and logical progression that fills an immediate connection between website and user, but I am a complete novice to this process.

In the next few months, I’ll need to get comfortable enough working within programming languages I’ve never seen that I can seamlessly integrate them with the English letters I’ve obsessed over for years. I know that should feel intimidating, but instead I’m excited. It might just be a symptom of my ignorance though, because right now I’m more unsettled by what I do know. In other words: I know I can’t code, but how do I know if I can write?

8th Light’s programmers subscribe to a practice that I really like called Test Driven Development. They set parameters for their work and use pre-made tests as they go to check that their code is functional and without bugs. Every line of code should serve the purpose of the project’s core vision. There are set expectations for each website or app, and this ensures that they function accordingly. But what does it mean for words to be functional? While writing software code is an unnatural and relatively rigid process, writing words is a very natural and fluid one. Everyone does it; I want to do it better.

This very blog platform is a testament to this dilemma. Anyone with an Internet connection can post words on a host like WordPress or Tumblr. So what makes me so special, and how can I make the most of this opportunity at 8th Light? How do I write tests that can check the functionality of my prose and make sure I’m operating without bugs in my writing?

That’s a problem I anticipate will follow me through this apprenticeship, and stick around long afterward. Even some of the most celebrated writers have been crippled by anxiety and self-doubt about their prose. But I take this to be more of a reflection of personal issues than professional ones, and I think if we can separate the two we can make improvements in the latter despite the former.

The important thing here is not to miss the forest for the trees. It does more harm than help to devalue writing because of its platform. It’s not the ease with which something is written, but the ease with which it can be read that matters. And ultimately I think that’s the signature of good writing—it fosters good reading.

That’s still too abstract of a concept to fit in with Test Driven Development, but the principle is the same—the ends should dictate the means; every line of prose should serve the purpose of the project. So while I need to continue pursuing this test-driven approach to good writing, I also need to make sure I’m not just adding hurdles to the process that sacrifice clarity of thought for clarity of conscience.

Instead, I expect the greatest hurdles are going to be the things that exist already. They’re the ones that everyone has. At a fundamental level, English-speaking humans can all communicate with one another; but at a higher granularity you can see that each person forms their own neural pathways to the same conversation. For prose to resonate universally (as you should hope it would on a website or application), it should be void of these nuances to convey the most fundamental and basic form of a message possible. The personal writer should remove himself from the project and leave the writing to the professional.
