[Punter](https://blowbloodrecords.bandcamp.com/album/demo-cs-5) play a kind of melodic hardcore that I can't quite put my finger on. Based out of Melbourne, they play some pretty straightforward snotty punk rock, exactly like the mix of oi and street punk I was getting real into around 18 years oldâ€”but then they throw in backing vocal harmonies alongside these gigantic distorted guitar hooks, and the effect is so much bigger than the sum of its parts. 

I learned about Punter from Tom Breihan's new monthly hardcore column at Stereogum, [Let the Roundup Begin](https://www.stereogum.com/2069771/let-the-roundup-begin-the-month-in-hardcore-january-2020/franchises/let-the-roundup-begin/), which also highlighted great albums from [Frail Hands](https://frailhands.bandcamp.com/album/parted-departed-apart) (screamo) and [Chubby and the Gang](https://staticshockrecords.bandcamp.com/album/speed-kills) (street-punk), but nothing I've heard so far in 2020 has caught my ear and stayed in it quite like Punter's Demo. Maybe you haven't been filled with as much anxious energy as I've been, but I suspect the hooks and harmonies will give this some crossover appeal.

A new Drug Church single, "Bliss Out," caused me to revisit their 2018 album Cheer this month, and it was a revelation. Coincidentally or not (whom can say), it shares a lot of the same vibes as Punter's demo. Even if it doesn't feel as rushed, the songs share a similar snotty, anti-capitalist, and triumphant tone that makes me feel like I'm 19 years old and ready to run through a brick wall.

Cheer isn't quite the blitzkrieg of Punter, but it's maybe something you could get away with calling post-hardcore. I'm thinking of a comparable band being like Fiddlehead or Touche Amore, and Drug Church's hooks similarly seem to swirl around a vocalist who can't necessarily reach a wide range but still carries a commanding presence through sheer force of will. But if we move past aesthetics, a lot of these songs honestly sound a lot like classic Les Savy Fav. 

What really sets apart Cheer for me was the way it uses its aggression to ease you into something more comforting. Even when a song like "Unlicensed Hall Monitor" starts out with a pretty heavy and immediate riff punctuating their hatred of "a born asshole," they tap the brakes about 2/3rds of the way through for a reflective outro paced by vocalist Patrick Kindlon repeating, "but man it makes me sick to sing this." The whole album is full of lyrics operating at a distance like this. Kindlon's overarching message is definitely angry and anti-capitalist, but he takes time to flesh out more poignant and humane portraits of late capitalism. 

I've gotta assume I'm doing an awful lot of projecting here, but the effect it's had on me is channeling anti-capitalist rage into something inflamed with a shared humanity. I suspect Kindlon has thought through this stuff as well, as he's one of the more driven and interesting voices in hardcore (in addition to this band, he also sings in Self Defense Family, hosts a podcast about hardcore called Axe to Grind, and makes popular comic books). He's a pretty fascinating guy, and if you want to learn more you can read a really great interview with him from September 2018 in Vice. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwpwm3/drug-church-patrick-kindlon-cheer-interview

I have no idea why it took me a year and a half to get caught up in this stuff, honestly.

I'm also surprised it took till now for me to find out about Beach Bunny. Their new album, Honeymoon, is a perfect blend of power-pop-punk that I can't stop listening to.

Kvelertak is my favorite metal band, and their new album, Splid, is another instant classic.


One of my favorite albums from 2019 was Strange Ranger's Remembering the Rockets, but I've spent a lot of 2020 so far revisiting Rot Forever, the first LP they put out back when they went by Sioux Falls. It's a lot more raw than the newer stuff, both in its angst and in how closely it resembles its source material. "Dom" sounds like it could've been an early draft of "Adam's Song," and I'd believe you if you told me "Your Name's Not Ned" is actually a Built to Spill cover. There are at least a dozen more moments scattered throughout the album that sound more like ripoffs than tributes, but it doesn't bother me so much because it's so dang catchy and charming. They play with an energy that reminds of of Deseparecidos, even when they're trying to pull off lines like "All my friends are getting old / Seattle lost the Super Bowl." 
I guess it helps to know this is the same band that would go on to make an accomplished album like Remembering the Rockets; but just like I enjoy the bands that inspired them, I've also found a lot to enjoy in their own formative moments.

Dom sounds like it could be
