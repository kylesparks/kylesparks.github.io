manson background (w/ bugliosi)


The book is about the Manson murders, but it's told 
The book is also about Tom O'Neill's journey tracking down the info and sinking lower and lower into 

Charles Manson's is one of the most told stories in American history, so I'll keep the background brief. 

BOOK BACKGROUND
CHAOS originally started as a magazine assignment some 20 years ago. He was supposed to write a story for the now-defunct Premier Magazine about the 30th anniversary of the Manson Family Murders. So he started digging into the files, talking to some of the folks involved, looking for a fresh angle he could take on one of the most told and re-told stories in American history. He missed his deadline, of course. What he found was not so much a new angle, but an alternative reality of sorts. And this book, CHAOS, is about his long, slow process of uncovering this new reality.

And I think it’s helpful to break it up thematically into two parts - digging into the case files and trying to figure out what really happened, and then just getting pulled all the way out of the case itself and into a whole shadow world.
What really happened?
Lol wait, what?
[3]
Let’s start with some background around Charles Manson. He’s probably familiar to most of you.

MANSON BACKGROUND
Manson was raised in a troubled home in Cincinnati. His mom struggled with alcohol and substance abuse and spent a chunk of Charles’ childhood in prison. Charles got caught up in similar trouble—often skipping school, running away from home, robbing stores, stealing cars, and continued to get into trouble in prison, several times appearing close to getting parole but then doing something—like pulling knives on other kids—to have it denied. 

I’m going to skip ahead to when he finally got out on parole—his parole officer told him to go to San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district and hopefully find happiness in the summer of love. of course that's where he started making friends and growing his influence, eventually palling around with Beach Boys’ drummer Dennis Wilson for a whole summer, and then moving his followers to squat on a ranch in the desert. Eventually, Charles was arrested along with several members of his family for some highly graphic, gruesome murders. These parts I think probably we all remember.

[4]
Vincent Bugliosi—maybe you don’t remember his name, but you’re likely familiar with his work as the lead prosecutor of the case, and the eventual author of the hit “true crime novel” Helter Skelter, which lays out his case: Charles Manson had brainwashed his followers (and possibly himself) into thinking there was an impending race war, during which they’d hide out safely in the desert, only to emerge after this apocalyptic event to a more perfect union—I haven’t actually read Helter Skelter, but I think that’s the gist. 

So that’s where O’Neill started—reading Helter Skelter and talking to Bugliosi, and he found a lot of bizarre things in the case that raised questions. 

[5]
I’m not going to go through them all now—you quickly get the sense that Bugliosi knew a best-selling book when he saw it. But there are a few—like his explanation for why Manson targeted the house on Cielo Drive where Sharon Tate was living is because his friend who was failing to give him a record deal with the label he helped his mom run used to live there? And the cops didn’t crack the case till two months later when Susan Atkins was arrested for stealing a car and then bragged about the murder to her cell mate, who phoned in the tip. Why did it take so long if the evidence was so compelling? There were a lot of questions about the evidence, maybe they didn't deliberately plant and remove things but there are definitely different stories about who and what was where and when, but I don’t have 500 pages to lay it all out.

Instead, the part I figured I’d address in this talk is not really something Bugliosi did wrong, but something he didn’t really do at all. Hardly anything had been reported about Manson’s time in the Haight-Ashbury district—which is kind of surprising, as that’s where he transforms from lifelong criminal to charismatic cult figure.

CONSPIRACY BACKGROUND
[6]
So here we go. San Francisco, 1967, Summer of Love. We’re going to introduce some new characters.

[7]
David Smith was working on his PhD in pharmacology at UC Berkeley, studying (and he published a research paper on) the effect of different drugs on groups of mice and/or rats—it’s inconsistent, though that detail isn’t so important. 

David also spent some time volunteering with a “community anarchist” group called The Diggers. The Diggers provided food, housing, and medical aid to runaways in the Bay Area.

Going into the mid-60s David foresaw a huge migration and gentrification of young folks moving into San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district, though he also knew the area lacked affordable medical resources. David is a proper gentleman who believed health care is a human right, so, taking inspiration from The Diggers, he left his studies and opened the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic (HAFMC).

[8]
The clinic was staffed largely by volunteers, and treated hundreds of patients a day—with bad trips, overdoses, STDs, malnourishment, therapy…

It was the Summer of Love, and the vibes fit the neighborhood. They encouraged loitering, exam rooms were painted in wavvy colors, one of them wallpapered with peace signs and swirls and naked people and whatnot.

But it wasn’t without its controversy. Despite being an inspiration for the space, the Diggers’ founder, Emmett Grogan, was skeptical. Here’s a quote: “Just because no one was made to pay a fee when they were there, didn’t make it a free clinic,” he wrote. “On the contrary, the patients were treated as ‘research subjects’ and the facility was used to support whatever medical innovations were new and appropriate to the agency.”

And he had a point! One of the ways the HAFMC was able to be free was that it received private and federal grants to conduct drug research.

[9]
Of course David Smith wasn’t the lone paid professional here, and the other one I’ll focus on today is Roger Smith (no relation). He was a doctoral candidate from Berkeley who studied criminology, more specifically the link between drugs and gang violence. 

As sort of a side gig or something, he also worked for a very brief time as a parole officer. He was actually participating in a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health called the San Francisco project, which was an experimental parole program to determine whether the different number of cases a PO has might affect recidivism rates of parolees. Apparently Roger Smith started the study with 40 parolees, and by the end of the year he had only one: Charles Manson. He brought Manson with him to Haight-Ashbury.

[10]
Together at HAFMC, the Smith's worked on a study titled Amphetamine Research Project (ARP). Original. We can get an idea what was going on just from the name. We also know this study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), though there isn’t much documentation to tell us more. The Smiths say—ah well sorry, who can say, long time ago. However, two of their coworkers remember it differently. The HAFMC’s original chief psychiatrist, Dr. Ernest Dernburg, and forensic psychologist Stephen Pittel, both promise that the ARP files were burglarized shortly after Manson’s arrest. Nothing else was taken from the facility.

To be clear: The National Institute of Mental Health is the world’s biggest scientific organization dedicated to mental health causes, so there’s a lot going on, and there’s a lot of money coming from and going to different places, but it should be noted that they’ve acknowledged that the CIA did use the organization as a front for conducting LSD research, and here we have a health facility doing research with amphetamines and LSD and is receiving at least some money from them.

[11]
So let’s take stock of where we are right now. it looks kinda like this, right? Lots of kinda faint connections between different things. Again I’m leaving out a lot of what’s in the book, but I think there’s enough here to pull back a bit and talk about the CIA.

[12]
==========THE CIA

[13]
TIMELINE
1947: After FDR’s death, Harry Truman realized he knew very little about what was rapidly becoming this sprawling empire, and he needed a formal process of receiving insights from the distributed abroad. He didn’t love what he learned!

Korea was split into North and South in 1948

1950: Korean War
	first use of “brainwash”

1951: beginning project ARTICHOKE - 
First known attempt at researching interrogation methods and potential for coercion—notably, they feared the Soviets had developed an all-purpose truth serum, so they started experimenting with cocaine, marijuana, heroin, peyote, and mescaline, before identifying LSD as the most promising drug

1952: american POWs admitted to spraying illegal biological weapons on the korean countryside—something that surprised the U.S.!

1953: The New York Times published a big story about American POWs returning from war having possibly been “converted” by “communist brain-washers”
	This same year, newly appointed director of the CIA Allen Dulles gave a speech to princeton alumni in which he talked about “brain warfare”, “the war of ideologies,” and whether “we realize how sinister the battle for men’s minds has become in soviet hands.”
		This is how Dulles rationalized the rise of communist-friendly sentiment—americans have free minds, while the soviets must have a “mind control” engine that’s tricked everyone behind the iron curtain into believing their ideology
			In my opinion, he was very paranoid.
		And three days after his speech, Dulles approved the beginning of MK-Ultra, which would massively expand the efforts of project ARTICHOKE

[14]
MK-Ultra’s umbrella goal was “to influence human behavior”—including bringing out deep confessions, or wiping a subject’s mind clean and reprogramming them. All of this was headed by a guy named Sydney Gottlieb, and under this umbrella were 149 subprojects—many but not all carried out on unwitting participants. most of them were pushed out through foundations, hospitals, prisons, and various shell companies—which of course included the National Institute of Mental Health, which we covered earlier. 
One of the willing subjects was Ken Kesey, author of one flew over the cuckoo’s nest, who was working at a hospital at the time and volunteered to try LSD—he liked it! And he’d go on to share it. This is a common story: LSD really started to spread because the US because the CIA did experiments on folks who liked it.
Similar stories for Robert Hunter, lyricist for the Grateful Dead; 
the poet Allen Ginsberg; 
and you’ll never guess who else: Whitey Bulger. He volunteered while in prison, but it sounds like he was not one of those who liked it, writing: “Eight convicts in a panic and paranoid state… Total loss of appetite. Hallucinating. The room would change shape. Hours of paranoia and feeling violent. We experienced horrible periods of living nightmares and even blood coming out of the walls. Guys turning to skeletons in front of me. I saw a camera change into the head of a dog. I felt like I was going insane.” Wild stuff!
There were tens, probably hundreds of thousands of subjects in these projects. Another noteworthy one was Frank Olson

[15]
Frank Olson was a scientist who worked for the army in camp detrick, maryland. as part of mkultra, he was given a dose of LSD without his knowledge, and eventually suffered a severe psychiatric response. His family knew something was wrong—he was visibly depressed—but even he didn’t know what he’d been put through, so they didn’t have any ideas what was going on. They figured it’s just work stress, or something. 

CIA knew, though. They sent him to NY to see one of their psychiatrists, who recommended he be placed in a mental institution for recovery. Before he got that help, and before heading back to Maryland, he was spending a night in a new york hotel room with another CIA employee, when olson—I’ll say “exited” the hotel room window and fell to his death.

This whole story is the subject of the six-episode film series by errol morris, it’s called wormwood and it’s on netflix.

[16]
What’s in a name? MK is just boring jargon that means the project was sponsored by the CIA’s Technical Services Staff; Ultra means this was designated as the most secret classification of WWII intelligence.
	How secret? MKUltra was so highly classified (ultra classified) that when allen dulles left as cia director in late 1961, his successor was reportedly not informed of its existence. When Sydney Gottlieb retired in 72 or 73, the project effectively retired with him. 

[17]
So let’s update the timeline with some of these new facts.

Frank Olson died in 1953, which means they should’ve known how deadly this practice was 14 years before Gottlieb pumped money into the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic. Of course, they did it anyway, the Manson family murdered at least seven people—probably a lot more, though that’s outside the scope of my talk. Shortly thereafter the paperwork that could’ve told us about Manson’s time at HAFMC was burglarized.

1973, only three years later, amidst the watergate scandal, gottlieb got paranoid and destroyed all MKUltra files—or so they thought, as they forgot at least 16,000 pages in an off-site warehouse.

These pages were discovered in a FOIA, and in 1974, Seymour Hersh used them as evidence in his report on the front page of the new york times: “Huge CIA Operation Reported In US Against Antiwar Forces”

Three government investigations followed, including Gerald Ford’s Rockefeller Commission and congress’ Church Committee, which told us about Frank Olson, but they could only probe so deep when a lot of the evidence had been put through the paper shredder and burned.

[18]
So after all that we end up with something more like this. It’s starting to get a bit more involved, but I want to stress that I’ve only given you a 15 minute overview, and this book is 400-some pages of details, and it seems like it took a lot of work trimming it to that.

[19]
Here’s a picture included at the end of the book of Tom O’neill in his office, surrounded by the paperwork from 20 years of obsessive reporting, all of which went into making this book.

I barely scratched the surface of the kind of details in here. For every fact I shared, he’s got a couple hundred more—more compelling and more colorful and everything. But I was trying to cherry pick a few that I could fit within a tight 15 or whatever and would hopefully fit together into kind of a mini-story that could make sense on its own. 

And I realized [just last night] after thinking I’d finished putting this together, I talked about MKUltra, but I didn’t talk about the CIA project he named his book after. So, speed round:

[20]
Operation CHAOS was a domestic espionage project from 1967 to 1974 whose goal was to investigate counterculture and protest groups and try to dig up the foreign influence that was driving it. It acted sort of like the twin program of COINTELPRO, and they collaborated on some efforts to track Americans abroad. And I believe that’s why the CIA expanded MKUltra outside of prisons and hospitals and into counterculture centers—like the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Center. 

I think it’s a good title for another reason though, which I think is the part where some folks I’ve heard haven’t really loved it. I think some people find his writing style kind of grating, which I can understand. But mostly I think folks can find it frustrating to read this 400-some page investigation and never find a smoking gun. Perhaps you all here can relate!

But I like this better because I think this is what it’s like in a proper conspiracy.

Some people think we’ll be able to find a paper trail that goes all the way to a single source, but that’s not really how it works. There’s no single hand orchestrating it. 

Sydney Gottlieb is not playing Manson like a marionette. Manson isn’t going to weekly check-ins with some CIA case officer updating them on how ready his new friends are for murder.

Instead, it’s all these independent people doing independent things that make sense within their own independent universe and not totally knowing how it affects adjacent universes. 

And in that ocean of independent lives, the CIA just dropped little chaos agents. They started handing out acid, and then waited to see what happened next. They did this thousands and thousands of times, and they had a few very high profile, very awful results! 

So they closed it. They ended Operation CHAOS; after seven years and a half dozen major reports, they found nothing to say foreign elements were playing a major role in these movements.

And so it’s been a few weeks, months now I guess that all these ideas have been kinda floating around and cementing themselves in my head. And honestly, I’m not lying to you, about 1230-1am last night as I was finally thinking I was done with this, a thought popped into my head. 

[20]
Revisit this timeline. We have the HAFMC founded in 1967, the Manson Family gets treatment, two years later they’re caught and charged with committing multiple disturbing murders. And then, the same year Seymour Hersh unravels MKUltra, Vincent Bugliosi publishes Helter Skelter and makes sure everyone knows about the dark underbelly of this hippy counterculture. 

Now check this out.

[21]
Operation CHAOS was active for seven years: 1967 to 1974. So it kinda makes you wonder: did Operation CHAOS every really end? Or did it just outsource itself.






NEW CONCLUSION
In the months since reading this, the ideas have been kicking around in my head, and I've got a new story.
  {} Manson as a lost welfare case, lost in the cracks...
    
But that's not the only ting.

Project CHAOS started to investigate any darkside of antiwar, anticapitalist, anti-racist movements. It didn't find any, and it closed on [date].

But now consider this:
That same year, Bugliosi published Helter Skelter, which shocked the nation, and seemed to reveal a dark underbelly in hippy counterculture. 

And so I wonder: did Project CHAOS really stop? Or was it like so many other government programs thorughout this era of neoliberalism—outsourced to another party that didn't need to worry so much about what
