Most of what we know about MK-Ultra and Operation CHAOS we learned from Seymour Hersh's reporting in The New York Times, based on a collection of some 16,000 pages of documents that Sydney Gottlieb forgot to destroy.

Gottlieb led the ultra-secret MK-Ultra program, which included 140 sub-projects. Many but not all of them consisted of administering drugs and observing behaviors of unwitting participants. Most of them were also pushed out through foundations, hospitals, prisons, and various shell companiesâ€”of course including the National Institute of Mental Health.

This program was so secret that when Allen Dulles left as CIA Director in late 1961, his successor was not briefed on what Gottlieb was up to. When Gottlieb retired in '72 or '73, the project effectively retired with him. Amidst the Watergate scandal he got paranoid and ordered all documents be destroyed, but the 16,000 pages that Hersh dug up were forgotten in some auxiliary warehouse.

Operation CHAOS was a domestic espionage project from 1967 to 1974 whose goal was to investigate counterculture and protest groups and try to dig up the foreign influence that was driving it. It acted sort of like the twin program of the FBI's COINTELPRO, and they collaborated on some efforts to track Americans abroad. 

Three government investigations followed, including Gerald Ford's Rockefeller Commission and congress' Church Committee, but there's still a ton that we'll never know.
