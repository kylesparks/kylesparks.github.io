I'm all in on Bernie 2020 for a lot of reasons, including but not limited to:
- Only reliable & fierce advocate fore removing waste and profit motives from people's livelihoods with M4A 
- He's also willing to remove profit motive from climate change, expanding TVA and other PMAs that will provide green, renewable, affordable energy for all 
- ...And also pledging an order of magnitude more money than the second most giving candidate's plan for the Global Climate Fund, with a vision for building the Global South, whereas other plans simply transition from extracting resources to extracting cash  in exchange for our new & improved resources
- Only candidate fighting to: let prisoners vote, end deportations, abolish ICE 
- Views his role not as some unique leader, but as an organizer who will uplift marginalized voices and inspire the working class to take control of our democracy.

There are more points, but the purpose of this column is really just to focus on that last one, as we're already seeing what it looks like.

You see it in Bernie's volunteer and donation numbers...

You also see it in dozens of exciting candidates in down-ballot races across the country.

Of course I can't speak for all of these candidates and whether they endorse Bernieâ€”or if he's even their primary motivation for getting involved! But these are undeniably some of the faces of a new leftist and populist movement for which Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign has served as something like a pilot light.

The structural criticisms of electoral politics are all mostly correct, and while they're insufficient on their own, I do believe they are a necessary muscle for any revolution that seeks to take power while avoiding armed conflict.

Here are some of the candidates I've been inspired by this cycle. I'd love it if you told me whom else I should get to know.
