I read CHAOS a few months ago, and as the thoughts have slowly OSSIFIED in my brain, I've arrived at two new conclusions: Manson 
Manson's case might've been prevented by a proper welfare state
Project CHAOS never really ended, it just outsourced

CHAOS originally started as a magazine assignment some 20 years ago. Tom O'Neill was supposed to write a story for the now-defunct Premier Magazine about the 30th anniversary of the Manson case. So he started by digging into the files, talking to some folks involved, looking for a fresh angle he could take on one of the most told and re-told stories in American history. 

O'Neill missed his deadline, of course. What he found was not so much a new angle, but an alternative reality of sorts. And this book, CHAOS, is about his long, slow process of uncovering this new reality, and descending into the more PRECARIOUS area of conspiracy and insanity.

In the months since I've read this book, as the thoughts have slowly OSSIFIED in my brain, I've arrived at two thoughts that I'd like to expand on here. The first deals with the case of Charles Manson himself; the second deals with conspiracy.

Some brief biography of Charles Manson: Manson was born in a troubled home in Cincinnati. His biological father died before he was born; his mom struggled with alcohol and substance abuse, and spent a chunk of Charles' childhood in prison. Approaching adolescence, Charles got caught up in similar trouble—often skipping school, running away from home, robbing stores, stealing cars... and he continued to get into trouble in prison, several times appearing close to getting parole and then doing something—like raping another inmate at knifepoint—to have that possibility rescinded.

We can fast-forward quickly to when Manson finally did get out on parole. After being ignored for some time, his PO told him to go to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district and hopefully find happiness in the summer of love. Of course, that's where he started making friends and growing his influence, eventually palling around with Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson for a whole summer, and then moving his followers to squat on a ranch in the desert. Eventually, Charles was arrested along with several members of his family for some extremely gruesome murders.

The next character worth highlighting is Vincent Bugliosi. Maybe you don't remember his name, but you're likely familiar with his work as the lead prosecutor of the case, and the eventual author of the hit "true crime novel" Helter Skelter, which lays out the case that's been told and re-told for a half century: Charles Manson had brainwashed his followers (and possibly himself?) into thinking there was an impending race war, during which they'd hide out safely in the desert, only to emerge after this apocalyptic event to a more perfect union—I haven't actually read Helter Skelter, but I think that's the gist.

So that's where O'Neill started—reading Helter Skelter adn talking to Bugliosi, and he found a lot of bizarre things in the case that raised questions! If you want to learn them you can read the full book, but I'll quickly review one convenient example that's not so much something Bugliosi got wrong, but moreso something he sorta skipped over.

Hardly anything had been reported about Manson's time in the Haight-Ashbury district—which is kind of surprising, as that's where he transforms from lifelong criminal into charismatic cult figure. This summer is the scene of a perfect little microcosm for thinking about the broader conspiracy.

## Haight-Ashbury / Summer of Love 
David Smith was a PhD student at UC-Berkeley studying the effect of drugs on groups of rodents. David also spent some time volunteering with a "community anarchist" group called The Diggers, which provided food, housing, and medical aid to runaways in the Bay Area.

Going into the mid-60s, David foresaw a huge migration and gentrification of young folks moving into San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, though he also knew the area lacked affordable medical resources. David is a proper gentleman who believes health care is a human right, so, taking inspiration from The Diggers, he left his studies and opened the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic (HAFMC).

The HAFMC was staffed largely by volunteers, and treated hundreds of patients a day—with bad trips, overdoses, STDs, malnourishment, therapy... The office vibes even fit the neighborhood—they encouraged loitering, exam rooms were painted in wavvy colors, one of them wall-papered with peace signs and swirls and naked people and whatnot.

But it wasn't without its controversy. Despite being an inspiration for the space, the Diggers' founder, Emmett Grogan, was skeptical. Here's a quote: "Just because no one was made to pay a fee when they were there, didn't make it a free clinic," he wrote. "On the contrary, the patients were treated as 'research subjects' and the facility was used to support whatever medical innovations were new and appropriate to the agency."

And he had a point! One of the ways the HAFMC was able to be free was that it received private and federal grants to conduct drug research.

David Smith wasn't the lone paid professional here, and the other one worth highlighting here is Roger Smith (no relation). Roger was a doctoral candidate from Berkeley who studied criminology, more specifically the link between drugs and gang violence.

Roger also worked, for a very brief time, as a parole officer. He was actually participating in a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health called the San Francisco Project, which was an experimental program to determine whether the different number of cases a PO has might affect recidivism rates of parolees. Apparently Roger Smith started the study with 40 parolees, and by the end of the year had only one: Charles Manson. He's the parole officer I mentioned earlier, and he brought Manson with him to Haight-Ashbury.

Together at HAFMC, the Smiths worked on a study titled Amphetamine Research Project (ARP). We can get an idea what was going on just from the name, and we know this study was also funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), though there isn't much documentation to tell us more. When asked, the Smiths blamed this on, well, it was a long time ago, and that whole era was kind of a fog, wasn't it? However, two of their coworkers remember it differently. The HAFMC's original chief psychiatrist, Dr. Ernest Dernburg, and forensic psychologist Stephen Pittel both promise that the ARP files were burglarized shortly after Manson's arrest. Nothing else was taken from the facility.

To be clar: The National Institute of Mental Health is the world's biggest scientific organization dedicated to mental health causes, so there's a lot of money coming from and going to different places. But it should be noted that they've acknowledged that the CIA did use the organization as a front for funding LSD research, and here we have a health facility doing research with amphetamines and LSD and is receiving at least some money from them. And they're giving it to Charles Manson.
