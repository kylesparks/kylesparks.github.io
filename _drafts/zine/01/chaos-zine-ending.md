CHAOS is a trip. It's about 500 pages of the author, Tom O'Neill, getting closer and closer to some fundamental Truths, while simultaneously losing touch with reality. O'Neill started reporting as a magazine assignment some 20 years ago, looking for a unique angle on one of the most told and re-told stories in American history: The Manson family murders. What he found wasn't so much a new angle as a new reality of sorts, and CHAOS documents his long, slow descent into the dark matter that separates legitimate conspiracy and insanity. 

The story we've heard in _Helter Skelter_—of a uniquely evil individual leading a cult to murder—ignores context in favor of a neat, linear narrative of one historically demented individual. It's easy to understand, and it puts a face on evil.

CHAOS does a good job of showing how such a simple story fails us. There are dozens of characters in Manson's life who played some role in making him who he was. This is not to say they were evil, but that "evil" is complicated, and can result from an unfortunate chain of _incompetence_ and naivete. 

I'm going to quickly introduce a few of these side characters—including things that didn't happen as well as things that did—before eventually trying to piece it all together in a way O'Neill either couldn't or wouldn't.

## What Happened
Vincent Bugliosi led the prosecution in the Manson family trials, and wrote what's commonly regarded as the definitive accounting of the Manson family murders. I've never read it myself, but supposedly _Helter Skelter_ claims that Manson brainwashed his followers into thinking there was an impending race war... which they could incite through their own violence before hiding out in a cave under the desert, and eventually emerge to a more perfect union once it was all over.

So this is where O'Neill started his research: reading the book, talking to Bugliosi, finding some puzzling inconsistencies and bizarre conclusions, and then getting threatened by Bugliosi for pressing the issue. I'll leave it there.

It was bizarre to hear that _Helter Skelter_ spent so little time exploring what sure seems to be Charles Manson's formative year. Some background is helpful here.

### The Two Smiths
David Smith was a Ph D student at UC-Berkeley, studying the effect of drugs on groups of rodents. David also spent some time volunteering with a "community anarchist" group called The Diggers, which provided food, housing, and medical aid to runaways in the Bay Area.

As the story goes, David foresaw a huge migration and gentrification of young folks moving into San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district in the mid-60s, though he also knew the area lacked affordable medical resources. Being a proper gentleman who thinks health care is a human right, he took inspiration from The Diggers, left his studies, and opened the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic (HAFMC).

The HAFMC was staffed largely by volunteers and treated hundreds of patients a day—bad trips, overdoses, STDs, malnourishment, therapy... The office vibes also fit the neighborhood—they encouraged loitering, exam rooms were painted wavvy colors, one of them wallpapered with peace signs and swirls and naked people and whatnot.

But it wasn't without its controversy. Despite being an inspiration, The Diggers' founder, Emmett Grogan, was skeptical. Here's a quote: "Just because no one was made to pay a fee when they were there, didn't make it a free clinic," he wrote. "On the contrary, the patients were treated as 'research subjects' and the facility was used to support whatever medical innovations were new and appropriate to the agency."

And he had a point! One of the ways the HAFMC was able to be free was that it received private and federal grands to conduct drug research.

David Smith wasn't the lone paid professional at the HAFMC, and the other one worth highlighting here is Roger Smith (no relation). Roger was a doctoral candidate from Berkeley who studied criminology, more specifically the link between drugs and gang violence.

Roger also worked, for a very brief time, as a parole officer. He was actually participating in a study funded by the Naitonal Institute of Mental Health called the San Francisco Project, which was an experimental parole program to determine whether the different number of cases a PO has might affect recidivism rates of parolees. Apparently Roger Smith started the study with 40 parolees, and by the end of the year he had only one: Charles Manson. In 1967 he brought Manson with him to Haight-Ashbury.

Together at HAFMC, the Smiths worked on a study titled Amphetamine Research Project (ARP). We can get an idea what that was about from its title. We also know this study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), though there isn't much documentation to tell us more. The Smiths blame this on the normal erosion of time and told O'Neill not to read into it. Two of their coworkers remember it differently, and promised O'Neill that the ARP files were burglarized from the HAFMC shortly after Manson's arrest. Nothing else was taken from the facility. 

The NIMH is the world's biggest scientific organization dedicated to mental health causes, so there's a lot of money coming from and going to different places—but it should be noted that they've acknowledged that the CIA did use the organization as a front for conducting LSD research, and here we have a health facility doing research with amphetamines and LSD and is receiving at least some money from them.

## The CIA
I want to keep this an approachable length, so I'll quickly just outline two separate CIA programs that may or may not allegedly play a factor in this story: MK-ULTRA and Operation CHAOS.

MK-Ultra's umbrella goal was "to influence human behavior"—it was a direct response to seeing American soldiers go to Korea to fight communism and came back a different person. Some got captured and suddenly admitted to spraying illegal biological weapons. Others were coming home with more sympathetic views of communism than when they left. The new CIA Director Allen Dulles assumed this had to be some kind of brainwashing, and empowered Sydney Gottlieb to create a sprawling research arm that drugged thousands of people—some knowingly, some not—trying to find the ultimate truth serum or brainwashing cocktail. Most of this research was also pushed out through foundations, hospitals, prisons, and various shell companies—of course including the National Institute of Mental Health.

Operation CHAOS was a domestic espionage project from 1967 to 1974 whose goal was to investigate counterculture and protest groups and try to dig up the foreign influence that was driving it. It acted sort of like the FBI's COINTELPRO, and they collaborated on some efforts to track Americans abroad.

These programs were so secret that when Allen Dulles left as CIA Director in late 1961, his successor was supposedly never briefed on what Gottlieb was up to. When Gottlieb retired in 72 or 72, the project effectively retired with him. Amidst the Watergate scandal, he got paranoid and ordered all documents be destroyed. The only reason we know about these programs is he forgot to destroy 16,000 pages of documents in a separate warehouse, and Seymour Hersh found them.

Hersh reported these programs in The New York Times. Three government investigations followed, including Gerald Ford's Rockefeller Commission and congress' Church Committee, but there's still a ton that we'll just never know.

This is a problem for some who've read CHAOS and felt let down by the lack of a clean and clear conclusion. Like most conspiracies, there's no smoking gun at the end. Personally I prefer it this way, because I think it's a more honest representation of how these things work. Gottlieb was not playing Manson like a marionette. That was a side effect of sorts. I think a more accurate telling is that Gottlieb saw a volatile situation and injected a little chaos in the form of prescription amphetamines and psychedelics. Seems simple, understandable even. I can't help but wonder if there was something else going on.

## Quick Timeline
I think there's something else going on here, which O'Neill hints at, but I'm not beholden to any journalistic standards so I'm going to lay it out in really plain terms.

HAFMC opened in 1967, participating in the ARP and pumping drugs into the Haight-Ashbury district, including Manson.

In 1968, Manson moves his family to the Spahn Ranch and becomes obsessed with the Beatles' "Helter Skelter."

In July 1969, Gary Hinman is murdered in his home. In August 1969, Sharon Tate and four others were murdered in her home on Cielo Drive. In October 1969, Manson and several others are arrested for unrelated charges, and family member Susan Atkins brags about the murders.

In July 1970, Manson is found guilty and sentenced to death. Sometime that year, the ARP files are stolen from the HAFMC.

In 1973, Sydney Gottlieb orders all files related to MKUltra to be destroyed.

In 1974, Seymour Hersh publishes his bombshell story in the New York Times, exposing the CIA mind control experiments based on files that were mistakenly leftover from the previous year's purge.

That same year, Vincent Bugliosi publishes _Helter Skelter_, his novel-length accounting of the Manson family murders, and his theory behind them.

That same year, Operation CHAOS officially ends.

...Or does it? Stay with me for a moment.

## Engage Blackpill
Operation CHAOS' original charter was to uncover foreign influence on domestic leftist protest groups. Failing to find any of that, they succeeded in their overarching goal: undermining and discrediting these leftist groups, making them seem crazy, replacing happy images of loving comrades with gruesome scenes of unrecognizable violence. 

You see, my theory here is that Operation CHAOS never really ended, it just transitioned, outsourcing their dirty work to private parties like Bugliosi, who can be more effective because they're somehow less accountable and even more shameless.

This whole apparatus still exists today—pill mills, militarized police states, astro-turfed activists, and hack journalists all working in concert to divide us along race and class lines and undermine our efforts for a more peaceful, more generous, more just, and more humane society. American rags won't even print Seymour Hersh anymore! This system actively undermines anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-war movements with propaganda about "pragmatism." They work to further atomize our society, and create aliens and monsters where once there was neighbors, classmates, humans.

Because regardless of how much of this was deliberate and how much was an incident of chaotic forces, here's the story that the CIA doesn't want you to know:

Charles Manson was born in a broken home to a mother who was struggling with alcohol, substance abuse, and poverty. She spent a chunk of Charles' childhood behind bars. Charles got caught up in similar trouble—often skipping school, running away from home, robbing stores, stealing cars; and continued to get into trouble in prison, several times appearing close to getting parole but then doing something—like pulling knives and raping other inmates—to have it denied. The prisons just reinforced the only things he knew: they were cold, violent, and ruthless. And when he finally got out, instead of getting the education, therapy, prescriptions, and love he needed, he was put in an experimental program where his parole officer pumped him full of drugs that had already shown in a lab to create violent and antisocial behaviors. And we were all horrified and surprised when he didn't come out behaving like everyone else.

Throughout all of human history, we've never had so *much*. And yet every year, millions of children around the world are forced to go without—without education, proper nutrition, stable housing or health care. There are millions of people who lack the basic shelter, warmth, and support they need to live happy, healthy, and thriving lives. If somehow they do persevere, each one of them is one botched science experiment from becoming something unrecognizable—victims of the war on drugs, prison industrial complex, military industrial complex, an economic system that makes them work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or something much, much worse. They're squeezed tighter and tighter from multiple angles until eventually, predictably, they break. That's the bleak reality of such a polarized, atomized, unequal society.

But my intention with this essay is not to sound bleak. What I'm hoping to get across here is that this is a man-made problem, and the solution can be just as simple. Imagine a governmental program that instead of distributing acid, distributed affordable housing, health care, public education, and nutrition. What you'll find is a similarly asymmetrical outcome, because these folks don't *just* avoid becoming the next Charles Manson. They become something totally different—someone who knows love and acceptance, and feels worthy of both.
