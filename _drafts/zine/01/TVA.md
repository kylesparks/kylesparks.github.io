Tennessee Valley Authority
Electricity For All

Got my first meaningful tattoo today. TL;DR - The Tennessee Valley Authority represents all I want in government policy and programs, including the sick logo. 

Created by FDR's New Deal to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee Valley region, it’s provided affordable, renewable energy to the region for ~9 decades, in addition to innovating fertilizers, farming techniques, and even our regional library system. Responding to science and public pressure, they began developing clean and renewable coal alternatives *in the 1960s*.

Contrast that with the alternative, which is not just polluting at unsustainable rates. We endure Chicago winters where ComEd shuts off poor people's heat, and summers of forest fires and blackouts all across California because PG&E would rather line their shareholders' pockets than invest in maintaining their infrastructure. 

To me, the TVA logo is a reminder that a better world is possible, and the tools for achieving it are all around us. 

Take, for example, Bernie Sanders’ Green New Deal plan. As president, Bernie would expand the TVA while also expanding four more Power Marketing Administrations (and build a fifth) so the entire country can escape this public-private boondoggle and fulfill TVA’s slogan: Electricity For All.

"For All" means more than just Americans. Bernie's GND plan also includes massive funding increases to the Global Climate Fund to combat the fact that the most acute harms of climate change happen in areas that can least afford to protect themselves. Even more, when Bernie's state-owned enterprises continue innovating renewable energy technologies, he will donate them to the global south so that they can grow and prosper without the harmful side effects that the global north caused in their rise. Contrast this with the capitalist approach—in which we go from extracting resources to extracting capital, leaving people in a perpetual cycle of austerity and resource scarcity.

More locally, Chicago DSA is running a similarly inspired campaign in Democratize ComEd (DemComEd). ComEd's contract with the city expires this December, and DemComEd is working to convince the city not to renew the contract, and instead buy up their assets and municipalize the grid. 

Saying "democratize" means it's not enough to simply take something private and make it public. The state already has regulatory and oversight authority to tell ComEd (or PG&E) what they can and can't charge for their utilities. But after decades of neoliberalism, the state itself also needs support. We can't just pass off leadership from the leaders of ComEd to the leaders in City Hall. We need to give leadership to the people. DemComEd is an acknowledgement that municipalization is just the first step toward a larger democratization effort that we can realize when voters hold an elected board accountable for running the utility in the public's interest.

Last year, ComEd took home $100 million in profits for providing a basic utility. Some of this money went to green technology, though a lot of it also went to paying off shareholders. If we want to take the challenge of climate change seriously, we can't afford to skim anything off the top. 
In a Democratized Energy Utility, we will invest even more in expanding green energy sources, subsidizing poor households' bills, improving insulation in our public schools and office buildings, and serving as an example the rest of the world can follow.
