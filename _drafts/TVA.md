Tennessee Valley Authority
Electricity For All

Got my first meaningful tattoo today. TL;DR - The Tennessee Valley Authority represents all I want in government policy and programs, including the sick logo. 

Created by FDR's New Deal to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee Valley, it’s provided affordable, renewable energy to the region for ~9 decades, in addition to innovating fertilizers, farming techniques, and even our regional library system. Responding to science and public pressure, they began developing clean and renewable coal alternatives *in the 1960s*.

Contrast that with the alternative, which is not only polluting at unsustainable rates. We endure Chicago winters where ComEd shuts off poor people's heat, and summers of blackouts and forest fires all over California because PG&E would rather not invest in maintaining their infrastructure. 

To me, the TVA logo is a reminder that a better world is possible, and the tools for achieving it are all around us. Take, for example, Bernie Sanders’ Green New Deal plan. As president, Bernie would expand the TVA while also expanding four more Power Marketing Administrations (and build a fifth) so the entire country can escape this public-private boondoggle and fulfill TVA’s slogan: Electricity For All.
