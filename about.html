  	<h3>&#x1F47B; oh, hey!</h3>
  	<p>I live in Chicago, ride my bicycle, play 16” softball, and some other stuff:</p>

    <h4>&#x1F4D6; i read</h4>
    <p>I think you can follow my favorite reads on <a href="https://getpocket.com/@kylesparks">Pocket</a>. I also made a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75907363-kyle-sparks">Goodreads</a> account. It's unlikely I'll keep updating these regularly.</p>
  
    <h4>&#x270F; i write</h4>
    <p>on this here site, and also for a software company called <a href="https://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>. a lot of that work stuff is under an NDA, but feel free to honk at me if you'd like a copy of this <a href="https://pages.8thlight.com/beyond-the-buzzword-blockchain-download?hsCtaTracking=9914285d-a248-469f-8db6-24bdf6c61f1c%7C92b291a5-2e42-42d2-979c-615edfa1f0f4">blockchain field guide</a>.</p>
  
    <h4>&#x1F3B6; i music</h4>
    <p>Peruse through what I bought on <a href="https://bandcamp.com/kylesparks">Bandcamp</a>, what I streamed on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/kylesparks">Spotify</a>, and a mostly complete list of what I’ve paid money to own physical versions of on <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/kylesparks/collection">Discogs</a>.</p>
  
    <h4>&#x1F4BB; i code</h4>
    <p>very poorly! couldn't even get the footer to stay fixed on the bottom, so i hacked myself a solution in the form of one more item in this list. your browser will probably be different and it'll look all busted anyway. oops!</p>
