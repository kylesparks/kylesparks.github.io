				<h2><a href="http://www.8thlight.com/portfolio/go-big">Go Big Recruiting case study</a></h2>
				<p>Kyle interviewed four people--including Go Big Recruiting's CEO Ross Tucker and Senior Recruiting Analyst TJ Gaynor--to compile a thorough account of 8th Light's reimagination and implementation of the national collegiate recruiting service's web presence. You can read the whole case study in <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/portfolio/go-big">8th Light's portfolio</a>.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://cityofbroadshoulders.org/">City of Broad Shoulders copy</a></h2>
				<p>Kyle wrote all of the copy that was featured on the event page for the City of Broad Shoulders, a networking event based in Chicago, Ill., during RailsConf. Mixing historical information with detailed event descriptions, Kyle's copy was called "exactly what [the host of the event] wanted." Even though the three-day event is long past, you can still read his words at the <a href="http://cityofbroadshoulders.org/">City of Broad Shoulders website</a> right now.</p>
